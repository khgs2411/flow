# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important rules and guidelines
- **This project leverages 'flow framework'**: This project uses the flow framework for project management. Follow flow conventions for tasks, iterations, and brainstorming. Try to use the skills agents where possible for the best results. Alternatively, use the slash commands to interact with the flow system.


## Repository Overview

Flow is a human-in-loop development methodology framework combining Domain-Driven Design principles with Agile philosophy. It provides AI-driven slash commands and agent skills that guide iterative development where humans make decisions and AI executes within that framework.

**Key Philosophy**: Humans drive architecture and decisions. AI implements within your framework. Context is never lost.

## Architecture

### Three-Part System

1. **`flow.sh` (~437KB)**: Self-contained deployment script with all framework content embedded as heredocs. This is the single distribution file users download. Generated by `build-standalone.sh`.

2. **`framework/` (source files)**: The canonical source content that gets embedded into flow.sh:

   - `DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (~3,900 lines) - Complete Flow methodology
   - `SLASH_COMMANDS.md` - All command definitions (28 commands)
   - `examples/` - Reference examples (DASHBOARD.md, PLAN.md, task files)
   - `skills/` - Agent skill definitions (6 skills with supporting files)

3. **Build System**:
   - `build-standalone.sh` - Generates flow.sh from framework sources
   - `release.sh` - Automates versioning, changelog, git tagging, GitHub releases
   - `VERSION` file - Single source of truth for version number

### Flow Framework File Structure (What Gets Deployed)

When users run `flow.sh` in their project, it creates:

```
user-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commands/          # 28 slash commands (AI helpers)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ flow-blueprint.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ flow-brainstorm-start.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (25 more)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ skills/            # 6 Agent Skills
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ flow-navigator/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ flow-planner/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ flow-implementer/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ flow-architect/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ flow-reviewer/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ flow-documenter/
â””â”€â”€ .flow/
    â”œâ”€â”€ DASHBOARD.md       # User's main workspace (progress tracking)
    â”œâ”€â”€ PLAN.md            # Static context (architecture, scope)
    â”œâ”€â”€ phase-N/task-M.md  # Task files with iterations
    â””â”€â”€ framework/         # AI reference files (read-only)
        â”œâ”€â”€ DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ SLASH_COMMANDS.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ skills/SKILLS_GUIDE.md
        â””â”€â”€ examples/
```

**Important**: `framework/` in the repo contains source files. When deployed to user projects, framework content goes to `.flow/framework/` as reference documentation.

### Multi-File Architecture Pattern

Flow uses a **dashboard-first** navigation model:

- **DASHBOARD.md**: Single source of truth for progress. Shows current work pointer (Phase/Task/Iteration), progress overview with ALL phases/tasks/iterations.
- **PLAN.md**: Static context - purpose, goals, architecture, DO/DON'T guidelines. Rarely changes.
- **phase-N/task-M.md**: Work files containing iterations, brainstorming, and action items. All tasks have iterations (no standalone tasks).

## Development Commands

### Building

```bash
# After editing files in framework/, rebuild the distribution
./build-standalone.sh

# This:
# - Validates commandâ†’framework reference mappings
# - Embeds all framework/* content into flow.sh via heredocs
# - Creates a self-contained ~437KB executable
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test in a clean directory
mkdir -p /tmp/test-flow
cd /tmp/test-flow
~/flow/flow.sh

# Verify deployment:
# - .claude/commands/ has 28 files
# - .claude/skills/ has 6 skill directories
# - .flow/framework/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md exists
# - .flow/framework/examples/ contains reference files

# Test with --force flag (overwrites existing files)
~/flow/flow.sh --force
```

### Releasing

Flow uses semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

```bash
# Single source of truth: VERSION file
cat VERSION  # e.g., 1.3.4

# Option 1: Automatic version increment
./release.sh --patch   # 1.3.4 â†’ 1.3.5 (bug fixes)
./release.sh --minor   # 1.3.4 â†’ 1.4.0 (new features)
./release.sh --major   # 1.3.4 â†’ 2.0.0 (breaking changes)

# Option 2: Manual version
echo "1.5.0" > VERSION
./release.sh

# release.sh automates:
# 1. Runs build-standalone.sh with VERSION
# 2. Prompts for changelog entry
# 3. Updates CHANGELOG.md
# 4. Creates git commit + tag
# 5. Pushes to GitHub
# 6. Creates GitHub release with flow.sh asset
```

**Version Guidelines**:

- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, doc updates, minor improvements
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New commands, new features, significant enhancements
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes to framework structure or command behavior

## Code Structure

### Slash Commands (28 total)

Defined in `framework/SLASH_COMMANDS.md`, extracted by `build-standalone.sh`:

**Plan Initialization (4)**: `flow-blueprint`, `flow-migrate`, `flow-plan-update`, `flow-plan-split`

**Phase Lifecycle (3)**: `flow-phase-add`, `flow-phase-start`, `flow-phase-complete`

**Task Lifecycle (3)**: `flow-task-add`, `flow-task-start`, `flow-task-complete`

**Iteration Lifecycle (7)**: `flow-iteration-add`, `flow-brainstorm-start`, `flow-brainstorm-subject`, `flow-brainstorm-review`, `flow-brainstorm-complete`, `flow-implement-start`, `flow-implement-complete`

**Navigation (3)**: `flow-next`, `flow-next-subject`, `flow-next-iteration`

**Status & Validation (5)**: `flow-status`, `flow-summarize`, `flow-verify-plan`, `flow-compact`, `flow-rollback`

**Backlog Management (3)**: `flow-backlog-add`, `flow-backlog-view`, `flow-backlog-pull`

### Agent Skills (6 total)

Defined in `framework/skills/`, each with SKILL.md and supporting files:

1. **flow-navigator**: Dashboard-first navigation guidance with status awareness
2. **flow-planner**: Planning new features, tasks, and iterations
3. **flow-implementer**: Implementation workflow with pre-implementation gates
4. **flow-architect**: Architecture decisions and PLAN.md updates
5. **flow-reviewer**: Read-only verification of plan consistency
6. **flow-documenter**: Task notes and findings documentation

Each skill can have multiple supporting files (e.g., TEMPLATES.md, PATTERNS.md, VERIFICATION.md).

### Build Script Logic

`build-standalone.sh` performs:

1. **Validation**: Ensures all commands in SLASH_COMMANDS.md have proper framework reference markers (ðŸ”´ REQUIRED or ðŸŸ¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED)
2. **Embedding**: Uses heredocs to embed framework content into flow.sh functions
3. **Version Replacement**: Injects VERSION file content into flow.sh header

Key functions generated in flow.sh:

- `extract_command()` - Parses SLASH_COMMANDS.md to extract individual command content
- `get_framework_content()` - Returns embedded DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md
- `get_example_*()` - Returns example files (DASHBOARD, PLAN, tasks)
- `get_skill_*()` - Returns skill definitions and supporting files
- `deploy_commands()` - Writes .claude/commands/\*.md files
- `deploy_framework()` - Writes .flow/framework/ files
- `deploy_skills()` - Writes .claude/skills/\* files

## Key Patterns

### Command Definition Format

Each command in `SLASH_COMMANDS.md` follows:

```markdown
## /command-name

**ðŸ”´ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: .flow/framework/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-600

OR

**ðŸŸ¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED**

<!-- COMMAND_START -->

[Command instructions that get extracted to .claude/commands/]

<!-- COMMAND_END -->
```

### Deprecation Handling

Old commands (renamed/removed in v1.0.11+) are tracked in `DEPRECATED_COMMANDS` array in flow.sh and cleaned up during `--force` deployments.

### Framework Reading Strategy

Commands fall into two categories:

- **Category A (ðŸ”´)**: Must read Quick Reference (lines 1-600) once per session
- **Category B (ðŸŸ¢)**: Self-contained, no framework reading needed

This minimizes context usage while ensuring AI has necessary methodology knowledge.

## Important Notes

- **NEVER edit flow.sh directly** - it's generated by build-standalone.sh
- **Always edit source files in framework/** - these are the canonical sources
- All framework content is embedded in flow.sh via heredocs (no external dependencies)
- The build validates command definitions before allowing deployment
- flow.sh is ~437KB and entirely self-contained for easy distribution

## Documentation

- **README.md**: User-facing guide (philosophy, quick start, workflow)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Contributor guide (fork, edit, build, test, release)
- **framework/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md**: Complete Flow methodology (~3,900 lines)
- **framework/SLASH_COMMANDS.md**: All 28 command definitions
- **framework/skills/SKILLS_GUIDE.md**: Agent skills documentation
- **framework/examples/**: Reference examples for AI learning

## Context for AI Instances

When working on this repository:

1. **Framework changes**: Edit `framework/*.md`, then rebuild with `./build-standalone.sh`
2. **Adding commands**: Add to `SLASH_COMMANDS.md` between `<!-- COMMAND_START -->` and `<!-- COMMAND_END -->`, update `COMMANDS` array in build script
3. **Adding skills**: Create in `framework/skills/`, add extraction function to build script
4. **Version changes**: Update `VERSION` file only (single source of truth)
5. **Testing changes**: Always test in clean directory with `./flow.sh --force` after building

The methodology is designed to be framework-agnostic and work with any AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), but the slash commands + skills integration is optimized for Claude Code.
