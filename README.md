# Flow Framework

**AI-in-the-loop iterative development that preserves context and prevents refactoring hell.**

_Domain-Driven Design meets Agile philosophy. You design the architecture and iterations. AI executes within your framework. Context never gets lost._

## Why Flow?

Building complex features with AI often leads to:

- **Context loss** across sessions
- **Refactoring cycles** from poor upfront design
- **Missed edge cases** discovered too late
- **Disconnected implementations** that don't fit together

Flow solves this by enforcing **structured planning before coding**:

```
Brainstorm ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Iterate ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Verify
```

Everything is preserved in `.flow/PLAN.md` - a living document that survives across sessions, AI models, and developers.

## Quick Start

### Install Flow (30 seconds)

**Option 1: Direct Download** (no git required)

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khgs2411/flow/master/flow.sh
chmod +x flow.sh && ./flow.sh
```

**Option 2: Clone & Run**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khgs2411/flow.git ~/flow-framework
cd /path/to/your/project
~/flow-framework/flow.sh
```

**What gets installed:**

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/commands/    # 28 slash commands
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flow-blueprint.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flow-brainstorm-start.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .flow/               # Framework docs
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EXAMPLE_PLAN.md
```

### Create Your First Plan

**For new projects:**

```bash
/flow-blueprint "Real-time collaborative text editor with conflict resolution"
```

**For existing projects:**

```bash
/flow-migrate existing-plan.md
```

**Start your first iteration:**

```bash
/flow-brainstorm-start "CRDT vs OT, WebSocket architecture, offline support"
/flow-next-subject  # Discuss and resolve each subject
/flow-brainstorm-review  # Generate iterations and pre-tasks
/flow-implement-start  # Begin coding
```

---

## How It Works

### The Flow Hierarchy

```
PHASE (Testing, Implementation, Polish)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK (Authentication, API Design)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ITERATION (Skeleton, Error Handling, Optimization)
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BRAINSTORM (Design before code)
          ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SUBJECTS (Key decisions to make)
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IMPLEMENTATION (Code with action items)
```

### Status Markers Track Progress

- `‚è≥ PENDING` - Not started
- `üöß IN PROGRESS` - Currently working
- `üé® READY` - Brainstorming complete, ready to code
- `‚úÖ COMPLETE` - Finished and verified
- `‚ùå CANCELLED` - Abandoned
- `üîÆ FUTURE` - Deferred to later version

### The Workflow

1. **Blueprint** - Create structured plan from requirements
2. **Brainstorm** - Design decisions before writing code
3. **Resolve Subjects** - Capture WHY for each decision
4. **Review** - Generate iterations and identify pre-tasks
5. **Implement** - Code with tracked action items
6. **Verify** - Ensure implementation matches plan
7. **Iterate** - Repeat for next feature increment

## Key Features

### üß† Brainstorming Sessions

Document design decisions with rationale BEFORE coding. Prevents refactoring hell.

```markdown
### Subject: API Authentication Strategy ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Use JWT with refresh tokens

**Rationale**:

- Stateless authentication scales better
- Refresh tokens provide security + UX balance
- Industry standard with mature libraries

**Action Items**:

- [ ] Implement JWT generation (jsonwebtoken)
- [ ] Create refresh token rotation
- [ ] Add token blacklist for logout
```

### üìã Pre-Implementation Tasks

Handle blockers discovered during brainstorming:

```markdown
### Pre-Implementation Tasks

#### ‚è≥ Task 1: Refactor Legacy Auth Module

**Why**: Current auth is tightly coupled to session storage
**What**: Extract to AuthService interface

- [ ] Create AuthService interface
- [ ] Implement JWTAuthService
- [ ] Update controllers to use interface
```

### üéØ Progress Dashboard

Always-visible navigation for complex projects:

```markdown
## Progress Dashboard

**Current Work**:

- **Phase**: [Phase 2 - Implementation](#phase-2-implementation) üöß
- **Task**: [Task 3 - API Layer](#task-3-api-layer) üöß
- **Iteration**: [Iteration 5 - Error Handling](#iteration-5-error-handling) üöß

**Overall Progress**: 47% (14/30 iterations complete)
```

### üì¶ Backlog Management

Move pending tasks out of active plan for token efficiency:

```bash
/flow-backlog-add 14-18  # Move tasks 14-18 to backlog
/flow-backlog-view       # See what's in backlog
/flow-backlog-pull 16    # Pull task 16 back to active plan
```

### ‚úÖ Plan Verification

Ensure your plan matches reality:

```bash
/flow-verify-plan  # Checks completed items exist in codebase
```

---

## Framework Philosophy

### The Human Body Metaphor

**Skeleton ‚Üí Veins ‚Üí Flesh ‚Üí Fibers**

Like building a body, you start with structure and progressively add complexity:

1. **Skeleton** (V1) - Basic structure, happy path only
2. **Veins** (V1) - Core data flow and connections
3. **Flesh** (V2) - Error handling, edge cases
4. **Fibers** (V3) - Performance, optimization, polish

**Why this works:**

- Prevents premature optimization
- Forces you to prove the architecture before adding complexity
- Each iteration builds on validated foundations
- Natural scope boundaries (V1/V2/V3)

### Core Principles

**1. Plan Before Code**
Design decisions documented upfront reduce refactoring by 80%.

**2. Context Preservation**
`.flow/PLAN.md` is the single source of truth. Anyone (human or AI) can resume work instantly.

**3. Explicit Over Implicit**
Every decision has documented rationale. No "we think this works" - only "we chose X because Y".

**4. Progressive Disclosure**
Focus on what's needed NOW. Defer complexity to later iterations.

**5. Brainstorm Before Implement**
Thinking time is cheaper than refactoring time.

## Real-World Example

**Scenario**: Building a payment gateway integration

### 1. Create Blueprint

```bash
/flow-blueprint "Stripe Payment Gateway Integration

Requirements:
- Credit card processing with 3D Secure
- Webhook handling for async notifications
- Retry logic: 3 attempts, exponential backoff

Constraints:
- Express.js backend
- Max 2-second response time
- PCI DSS compliant

Testing:
- Stripe test mode simulation
- Mock webhook events
"
```

**Result**: Structured plan with phases, tasks, iterations

### 2. Brainstorm First Iteration

```bash
/flow-brainstorm-start "Payment flow architecture, webhook security, retry strategy, error handling"
```

**AI creates**:

```markdown
### Subjects to Discuss

1. ‚è≥ Payment Flow Architecture
2. ‚è≥ Webhook Security & Verification
3. ‚è≥ Retry Strategy & Idempotency
4. ‚è≥ Error Handling & User Feedback
```

### 3. Resolve Each Subject

```bash
/flow-next-subject
```

**AI presents subject 1, you discuss together, AI captures:**

```markdown
### Subject 1: Payment Flow Architecture ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Two-phase commit pattern (reserve ‚Üí capture)

**Rationale**:

- Prevents double-charging on network failures
- Enables fraud checks between reserve and capture
- Stripe native support via PaymentIntent API
- Standard e-commerce pattern (Amazon, Shopify use this)

**Action Items**:

- [ ] Create PaymentIntent on checkout initiation
- [ ] Implement reserve endpoint (confirm payment)
- [ ] Implement capture endpoint (fulfill order)
- [ ] Add timeout for abandoned reservations (15min TTL)
```

**Repeat for subjects 2-4...**

### 4. Review & Create Work

```bash
/flow-brainstorm-review
```

**AI analyzes decisions and suggests**:

- 3 new iterations for Phase 1
- 2 pre-implementation tasks (refactor existing payment module)

### 5. Implement

```bash
/flow-implement-start
```

**AI creates**:

```markdown
### Implementation

**Action Items** (from brainstorming):

- [ ] Create PaymentIntent on checkout initiation
- [ ] Implement reserve endpoint (confirm payment)
- [ ] Implement capture endpoint (fulfill order)
- [ ] Add timeout for abandoned reservations (15min TTL)
- [ ] Implement webhook signature verification
- [ ] Add idempotency keys to API calls
- [ ] Create retry queue with exponential backoff
- [ ] Build error translation for user-friendly messages
```

You code, checking off items as you complete them.

### 6. Complete & Verify

```bash
/flow-implement-complete
```

**AI prompts for verification**:

```
Verification Notes:
- ‚úÖ Tested reserve ‚Üí capture flow with test cards
- ‚úÖ Verified webhook signature validation
- ‚úÖ Confirmed retry logic with network failure simulation
- ‚úÖ All error cases return user-friendly messages
- ‚úÖ Payment reservations auto-expire after 15min
```

**Iteration marked ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

## Using Flow Without Slash Commands

**The methodology is the core, not the commands.**

You can use Flow with ANY AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) by manually following the patterns:

1. Copy `.flow/EXAMPLE_PLAN.md` as template
2. Follow the hierarchy: Phase ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Iteration
3. Use status markers: ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚úÖ
4. Document decisions with rationale
5. Reference `framework/SLASH_COMMANDS.md` for guidance

**Example prompt for ChatGPT**:

```
Read framework/SLASH_COMMANDS.md section '/flow-blueprint'
and execute those instructions for "User Authentication System"
```

The AI will follow the steps manually. You lose autocomplete but keep the full methodology.

## Architecture

### Three-Part System

1. **`flow.sh`** (~146KB single file)

   - Self-contained deployment script
   - All framework content embedded via heredocs
   - Zero external dependencies
   - This is what gets distributed

2. **`framework/`** (source files for development)

   - `DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` - Complete methodology (3,897 lines)
   - `EXAMPLE_PLAN.md` - Payment gateway reference (509 lines)
   - `SLASH_COMMANDS.md` - 28 command definitions

3. **Build system**
   - `build-standalone.sh` - Generates `flow.sh` from sources
   - Embeds all framework content into single distributable file

### For Framework Developers

**Edit framework**:

```bash
# Edit source files
vim framework/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md
vim framework/SLASH_COMMANDS.md

# Rebuild distribution
./build-standalone.sh

# Test in a project
cd /path/to/test-project
~/flow/flow.sh --force
```

**Release new version**:

```bash
./release.sh --patch   # 1.1.4 ‚Üí 1.1.5
./release.sh --minor   # 1.1.4 ‚Üí 1.2.0
./release.sh --major   # 1.1.4 ‚Üí 2.0.0
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Why single-file distribution?

- **Portability** - Share one file, no dependencies
- **Reliability** - No network requests, no missing files
- **Simplicity** - Users just run `./flow.sh`

### Why separate source files?

- **Maintainability** - Edit markdown, not heredocs
- **Version Control** - Clean diffs on actual content
- **Development** - Use proper markdown editors

### Why brainstorm before code?

- **Prevents refactoring** - Design decisions upfront
- **Captures rationale** - WHY is preserved, not just WHAT
- **Async collaboration** - Team sees thought process

### Why pre-implementation tasks?

- **Real-world pattern** - Often need to refactor before new work
- **Explicit blockers** - No hidden dependencies
- **Brainstorm completeness** - Can't start coding until ready
