## Command Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Every command must:

1. **Read the framework guide** at the start to understand patterns and structure
2. **Find and parse .flow/PLAN.md** to understand current state
3. **Follow framework patterns exactly** (status markers, section structure, etc.)
4. **Update .flow/PLAN.md** according to framework conventions
5. **Provide clear next steps** to the user

**File Locations**:

- **Plan File**: `.flow/PLAN.md` (Flow manages the plan from this directory)
- **Framework Guide**: Search in order:
  1. `.flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
  2. `.claude/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
  3. `./DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project root)
  4. `~/.claude/flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (global)

**Finding PLAN.md** (all commands except `/flow-blueprint` and `/flow-migrate`):

- Primary location: `.flow/PLAN.md`
- If not found, search project root and traverse up
- If still not found: Suggest `/flow-blueprint` (new project) or `/flow-migrate` (existing docs)

**Status Markers** (use consistently):

- ‚úÖ Complete
- ‚è≥ Pending
- üöß In Progress
- üé® Ready for Implementation
- ‚ùå Cancelled
- üîÆ Deferred

**Tool Usage for Pattern Matching**:

When commands instruct you to "Find", "Look for", or "Locate" patterns in PLAN.md:

- **Use Grep tool** for:

  - Simple pattern existence checks (does pattern exist?)
  - Counting occurrences (`grep -c`)
  - Reading specific sections with context (`grep -A`, `-B`, `-C`)
  - Examples: Finding phase markers, checking status, locating sections

- **Use awk** ONLY for:

  - Extracting content between two patterns (range extraction)
  - Example: `awk '/start_pattern/,/end_pattern/ {print}'`

- **Prefer Grep over awk** for simple tasks - it's more efficient and clearer

**Examples**:

```bash
# ‚úÖ GOOD - Use Grep for pattern checking
grep "^### Phase 4:" PLAN.md
grep -c "^#### ‚è≥ Task" PLAN.md
grep -A 2 "^## üìã Progress Dashboard" PLAN.md

# ‚úÖ GOOD - Use awk for range extraction
awk '/^##### Iteration 5:/,/^#####[^#]|^####[^#]/ {print}' PLAN.md
awk '/\*\*Subjects to Discuss\*\*:/,/\*\*Resolved Subjects\*\*:/ {print}' PLAN.md

# ‚ùå BAD - Don't use awk for simple existence checks
awk '/^### Phase 4:/ {print}' PLAN.md  # Use grep instead
```

description: Create new .flow/PLAN.md for a feature/project from scratch
---

You are executing the `/flow-blueprint` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Create a brand new PLAN.md file from scratch for a new feature/project/bug/issue.

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Plan File Template pattern (lines 134-207), Task Structure Rules (lines 47-107)
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 2731-2928 for complete Plan File Template using Read(offset=2731, limit=197)

**Framework Reference**: This command requires framework knowledge to generate correct plan structure. See Quick Reference guide above for essential patterns.

**IMPORTANT**: This command ALWAYS creates a fresh `.flow/PLAN.md`, overwriting any existing plan file. Use `/flow-migrate` if you want to convert existing documentation.

**üí° TIP FOR USERS**: Provide rich context in $ARGUMENTS! You are the domain expert - the more details you provide upfront, the better the plan.

**Good example**:
```

/flow-blueprint "Payment Gateway Integration

Requirements:

- Integrate with Stripe API for credit card processing
- Support webhooks for async payment notifications
- Handle failed payments with retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)

Constraints:

- Must work with existing Express.js backend
- Maximum 2-second response time

Reference:

- See src/legacy/billing.ts for old PayPal integration
- Similar webhook pattern in src/webhooks/shipment.ts

Testing:

- Simulation-based per service (scripts/{service}.scripts.ts)
  "

```

**Minimal example** (AI will ask follow-up questions):
```

/flow-blueprint "payment gateway"

```

**Instructions**:

1. **INPUT VALIDATION** (Token-Efficient - Run BEFORE reading framework) ‚ö†Ô∏è UX PRINCIPLE 1:

   **Goal**: Determine whether to CREATE explicit structure or SUGGEST structure, while minimizing token waste on invalid input.

   **Step 1: Quick Scan for Hard Rules** (< 10 tokens check):
   ```
   IF $ARGUMENTS is empty OR just whitespace:
     REJECT: "‚ùå Missing project description. Provide at least a project name or brief description."
     STOP (don't proceed to framework reading)
   ```

   **Step 2: Detect Blueprint Mode** (< 50 tokens analysis) ‚ö†Ô∏è UX PRINCIPLE 4 (Explicit > Implicit):

   **Mode A: SUGGEST Structure** (User wants AI to design the plan)
   - Trigger: $ARGUMENTS contains NO explicit structure markers
   - Examples: "payment gateway", "user auth system", "build a todo app"
   - Behavior: Read framework, ask questions, generate suggested plan structure

   **Mode B: CREATE Explicit Structure** (User designed the plan already)
   - Trigger: $ARGUMENTS contains structural markers like:
     - "Phase 1:", "Phase 2:"
     - "Task 1:", "Task 2:"
     - "Iteration 1:", "Iteration 2:"
     - Or bullet lists suggesting phases/tasks/iterations
   - Examples:
     ```
     "Payment Gateway
     Phase 1: Foundation
     - Task 1: Setup Stripe SDK
     - Task 2: Create payment models

     Phase 2: Implementation
     - Task 1: Payment processing
       - Iteration 1: Basic flow
       - Iteration 2: Error handling"
     ```
   - Behavior: Honor user's explicit structure, create it as-is (with [TBD] for missing metadata)

   **Step 3: Semantic Check** (Only if Mode A and input seems vague):
   - Check if description is too vague to generate meaningful plan
   - Examples that ARE OK: "payment gateway", "user authentication", "real-time chat"
   - Examples that ARE TOO VAGUE: "help", "project", "thing"
   - If too vague:
     ```
     "ü§î Need more context. What are you building? Examples:
     - 'Payment gateway integration with Stripe'
     - 'Real-time collaborative text editor'
     - 'User authentication system with JWT'

     Or provide explicit structure:
     Phase 1: [your phase]
     - Task 1: [your task]"
     ```
   - If OK, proceed to step 4 (framework reading)

   **Step 4: Dry-Run Preview** (Only if Mode B - explicit structure detected):
   - Parse user's structure and show what will be created
   - Example output (200-500 tokens vs 5000+ token full generation):
     ```
     "üìã Detected explicit structure. I will create:

     **Phase 1: Foundation** ‚è≥
     - Task 1: Setup Stripe SDK ‚è≥
     - Task 2: Create payment models ‚è≥

     **Phase 2: Implementation** ‚è≥
     - Task 1: Payment processing ‚è≥
       - Iteration 1: Basic flow ‚è≥
       - Iteration 2: Error handling ‚è≥

     Missing metadata will use [TBD] placeholders (you can refine later).

     Proceed? (yes/no)"
     ```
   - If user says "no", ask what to change
   - If user says "yes", proceed to framework reading and creation

   **Token Savings**: Validation + preview = 200-500 tokens vs full generation rejection = 5000+ tokens wasted

2. **Read the framework guide AND example plan** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL (Only after validation passes):
   - **Search for DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md** in these locations (in order):
     - `.flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `.claude/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `./DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project root)
     - `~/.claude/flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (global)
   - **Search for EXAMPLE_PLAN.md** in same locations
   - **Read BOTH files completely** to understand:
     - Hierarchy: PHASE ‚Üí TASK ‚Üí ITERATION ‚Üí BRAINSTORM ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION
     - Plan file template structure (DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 2731-2928)
     - Real-world example structure (EXAMPLE_PLAN.md - all 509 lines)
     - Required sections: Framework Guide header, Overview, Progress Dashboard, Architecture, Testing Strategy, Development Plan, Changelog
     - Progress Dashboard format with iteration lists
     - Brainstorming session structure with Resolution Type labels (Type A/B/C/D)
     - Status markers and their lifecycle

3. **Analyze the feature request**: `$ARGUMENTS` (Mode-specific behavior) ‚ö†Ô∏è UX PRINCIPLE 4:

   **If Mode A (SUGGEST)**: AI designs the structure
   - Extract all provided information: requirements, constraints, reference paths, testing preferences
   - If user provided rich context (requirements, constraints, references), use it directly
   - If minimal context provided (just a name), prepare to ask follow-up questions in steps 4-5

   **If Mode B (CREATE)**: Honor user's explicit structure
   - Parse the provided structure (phases, tasks, iterations)
   - Extract any metadata provided (goals, purposes, requirements)
   - Use [TBD] for missing metadata (‚ö†Ô∏è UX PRINCIPLE 2: Never block for cosmetic reasons)
   - Skip questions in steps 4-5 UNLESS user explicitly asked for them
   - Example: If user provided structure but no testing strategy, use "[TBD] - Testing strategy to be defined"

4. **Check for reference implementation** (Mode A only, skip if Mode B):
   - If user mentioned reference paths in arguments (e.g., "See src/legacy/billing.ts"), read and analyze them
   - If no reference mentioned, ask: "Do you have a reference implementation I should analyze? (Provide path or say 'no')"
   - If reference provided, read and analyze it to inform the planning

5. **Gather testing methodology** (Mode A only, skip if Mode B - CRITICAL if asking):
   - If user provided testing details in arguments (e.g., "Testing: Simulation-based per service"), use them directly and skip to step 6
   - Otherwise, ask: "How do you prefer to verify implementations? Choose or describe:
     - **Simulation-based (per-service)**: Each service has its own test file (e.g., `{service}.scripts.ts`)
     - **Simulation-based (single file)**: All tests in one orchestration file (e.g., `run.scripts.ts`)
     - **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/classes after implementation (Jest/Vitest/etc.)
     - **TDD**: Write tests before implementation, then make them pass
     - **Integration/E2E**: Focus on end-to-end workflows, minimal unit tests
     - **Manual QA**: No automated tests, manual verification only
     - **Custom**: Describe your approach"
   - **CRITICAL follow-up questions**:
     - "What's your test file naming convention?" (e.g., `{service}.scripts.ts`, `{feature}.test.ts`, `{feature}.spec.ts`)
     - "Where do test files live?" (e.g., `scripts/`, `__tests__/`, `tests/`, `e2e/`)
     - "When should I create NEW test files vs. add to existing?" (e.g., "Create `{service}.scripts.ts` for new services, add to existing for enhancements")
   - **IMPORTANT**: These answers determine how AI creates/modifies test files in every iteration

6. **Gather any other project-specific patterns** (Mode A only, skip if Mode B):
   - File naming conventions (if mentioned or user specifies)
   - Directory structure preferences (if relevant)
   - Code style preferences (if mentioned)
   - Skip if not applicable to project type

7. **Generate .flow/PLAN.md** following EXAMPLE_PLAN.md structure exactly ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL (ALWAYS overwrites if exists):

   **Mode-Specific Behavior**:

   **If Mode A (SUGGEST)**: AI-generated comprehensive plan
   - Use information gathered from steps 4-6
   - Generate full structure with AI-designed phases/tasks/iterations
   - Fill in all metadata sections with detailed content
   - Follow all subsections below

   **If Mode B (CREATE)**: Honor user's explicit structure
   - Use user's provided structure exactly
   - Fill in metadata where provided by user
   - Use [TBD] placeholders for missing metadata (‚ö†Ô∏è UX PRINCIPLE 2 & 6: Honest communication)
   - Example Testing Strategy if not provided: "[TBD] - Testing strategy to be defined during first iteration brainstorming"
   - Example Architecture if not provided: "[TBD] - Architecture to be documented during design phase"
   - Still create ALL required sections (don't skip sections just because metadata is missing)
   - Note: .flow/ directory already exists (created by flow.sh installation)
   - **CRITICAL**: Use EXAMPLE_PLAN.md as your template - follow its structure exactly

   - **Framework reference header** (REQUIRED - copy format from EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 1-11):
     ```markdown
     # [Project Name] - Development Plan

8. **Depth**: Medium detail
   - Phase names and strategies
   - Task names and purposes
   - Iteration names only (no brainstorming subjects yet)

9. **Verify completeness before saving** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SELF-CHECK:
   - [ ] Framework reference header present (with üéØ Purpose line)?

description: Migrate existing PRD/PLAN/TODO to Flow's .flow/PLAN.md format
---

You are executing the `/flow-migrate` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Migrate existing project documentation (PLAN.md, TODO.md, etc.) to Flow-compliant `.flow/PLAN.md` format.

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Plan File Template pattern (lines 134-207), Task Structure Rules (lines 47-107), Status Markers (lines 28-46)
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 2731-2928 for complete Plan File Template using Read(offset=2731, limit=197)

**Framework Reference**: This command requires framework knowledge to convert existing docs to Flow structure. See Quick Reference guide above for essential patterns.

**IMPORTANT**: This command ALWAYS creates a fresh `.flow/PLAN.md`, overwriting any existing plan file. It reads your current documentation and converts it to Flow format.

**Instructions**:

1. **Read the framework guide AND example plan** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:

   - **Search for DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md** in these locations (in order):
     - `.flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `.claude/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `./DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project root)
     - `~/.claude/flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (global)
   - **Search for EXAMPLE_PLAN.md** in same locations
   - **Read BOTH files completely** to understand:
     - Flow's hierarchy: PHASE ‚Üí TASK ‚Üí ITERATION ‚Üí BRAINSTORM ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION
     - Plan file template structure (DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 2731-2928)
     - Real-world example structure (EXAMPLE_PLAN.md - all 509 lines)
     - Required sections: Framework Guide header, Overview, Progress Dashboard, Architecture, Testing Strategy, Development Plan, Changelog
     - Progress Dashboard format with iteration lists
     - All status markers (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ)

2. **Discover existing documentation**:

   - Check if user provided path in `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Otherwise, search project root for common files (in order):
     - `PRD.md` (common in TaskMaster AI, Spec-Kit)
     - `PLAN.md`
     - `TODO.md`
     - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
     - `ROADMAP.md`
     - `TASKS.md`
   - If multiple found, list them and ask: "Found [X] files. Which should I migrate? (number or path)"
   - If none found, ask: "No plan files found. Provide path to file you want to migrate, or use `/flow-blueprint` to start fresh."

3. **Read and analyze source file**:

   - Read entire source file
   - Detect structure type:
     - **STRUCTURED** (Path A): Has phases/tasks/iterations or similar hierarchy
     - **FLAT_LIST** (Path B): Simple todo list or numbered items
     - **UNSTRUCTURED** (Path C): Free-form notes, ideas, design docs
   - Extract key information:
     - Project context/purpose
     - Existing work completed
     - Current status/position
     - Remaining work
     - Architecture/design notes
     - V1/V2 splits (if mentioned)
     - Deferred items
     - Cancelled items

4. **Create backup**:

   - Copy source file: `[original].pre-flow-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)`
   - Confirm: "‚úÖ Backed up [original] to [backup]"

5. **Generate .flow/PLAN.md** based on detected structure (ALWAYS overwrites if exists):

   - Note: .flow/ directory already exists (created by flow.sh installation)

   **Path A - STRUCTURED** (already has phases/tasks):

   - Keep existing hierarchy
   - **CRITICAL**: Use EXAMPLE_PLAN.md as reference for all sections
   - **Add framework reference header at top** (copy format from EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 1-11):
     ```markdown
     > **üìñ Framework Guide**: See DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md for complete methodology and patterns used in this plan
     >
     > **üéØ Purpose**: [Brief description of what this plan covers - extract from existing docs]

     **Created**: [Original date if available]
     **Version**: V1
     **Plan Location**: `.flow/PLAN.md` (managed by Flow)
     ```
   - **Add/enhance Progress Dashboard section** (after Overview, before Architecture):
     - Follow EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 29-62 format exactly
     - Include: Last Updated, Current Work (with jump links), Completion Status, Progress Overview
     - **Ensure iteration lists are expanded** (read DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 2555-2567 for format)
     - **Remove duplicate progress sections** (search for patterns like "Current Phase:", "Implementation Tasks", old progress trackers)
     - **Update status pointers** (change "Search for 'Current Phase' below" to jump link to Progress Dashboard)
   - **Add Testing Strategy section** if missing (see EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 87-129):
     - Ask user about testing methodology if not clear from existing docs
     - Include all required fields: Methodology, Location, Naming, When to create, When to add
   - **Add Changelog section** if missing (see EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 544-549):
     - Populate with existing completion dates if available
     - Format: `**YYYY-MM-DD**: - ‚úÖ [Iteration X]: [description]`
   - **Identify redundant framework docs** (ask user if sections like "Brainstorming Framework" should be removed since Flow provides this)
   - Standardize status markers (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ)
   - Add jump links to Progress Dashboard
   - Preserve all content, decisions, and context
   - Reformat sections to match Flow template
   - Report: "Enhanced existing structure (preserved [X] phases, [Y] tasks, [Z] iterations, added Progress Dashboard, Testing Strategy, Changelog, removed [N] duplicate sections)"

   **Path B - FLAT_LIST** (todos/bullets):

   - Ask: "Group items into phases? (Y/n)"
   - If yes, intelligently group related items
   - If no, create single phase with items as iterations
   - **CRITICAL**: Use EXAMPLE_PLAN.md as reference for all sections
   - **Add framework reference header** (copy format from EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 1-11)
   - **Add Progress Dashboard** (follow EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 29-62)
   - **Add Testing Strategy section** (ask user about methodology, see EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 87-129)
   - **Add Changelog section** (see EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 544-549)
   - Convert items to Flow iteration format
   - Add placeholder brainstorming sessions
   - Mark completed items as ‚úÖ, pending as ‚è≥
   - Report: "Converted flat list to Flow structure ([X] phases, [Y] tasks, [Z] iterations, added Progress Dashboard, Testing Strategy, Changelog)"

   **Path C - UNSTRUCTURED** (notes):

   - Extract key concepts and features mentioned
   - **CRITICAL**: Use EXAMPLE_PLAN.md as reference for all sections
   - **Create Framework reference header** (copy format from EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 1-11)
   - Create Overview section from notes
   - Create Architecture section if design mentioned
   - **Create Progress Dashboard** (minimal - project just starting, see EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 29-62)
   - **Create Testing Strategy section** (ask user about methodology, see EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 87-129)
   - **Create Changelog section** with initial entry (see EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 544-549)
   - Create initial brainstorming session with subjects from notes
   - Mark everything as ‚è≥ PENDING
   - Report: "Created Flow plan from notes (extracted [X] key concepts as brainstorming subjects, added all required sections)"

6. **Add standard Flow sections** (all paths):

   - **Framework reference header** (follow EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 1-11)
   - Progress Dashboard (follow EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 29-62)
   - Testing Strategy (follow EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 87-129)
   - Changelog (follow EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 544-549)
   - Development Plan with proper hierarchy
   - Status markers at every level

7. **Smart content preservation**:

   - NEVER discard user's original content
   - Preserve all decisions, rationale, context
   - Preserve code examples, file paths, references
   - Preserve completion status and dates
   - Enhance with Flow formatting, don't replace

8. **Verify completeness before saving** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SELF-CHECK:
   - [ ] Framework reference header present (with üéØ Purpose line)?
   - [ ] Overview section present?
   - [ ] Progress Dashboard present (NOT optional - REQUIRED)?
   - [ ] Testing Strategy section present (ask user if missing)?
   - [ ] Changelog section present?
   - [ ] Development Plan with phases/tasks/iterations?
   - [ ] All iteration lists expanded (NOT "(X iterations total)")?
   - [ ] All original content preserved?
   - **If any checkbox is unchecked, review EXAMPLE_PLAN.md again and add missing section**

9. **Confirm to user**:
```

‚ú® Migration complete!

üìÇ Source: [original file path]
üíæ Backup: [backup file path]
üéØ Output: .flow/PLAN.md

Migration type: [STRUCTURED/FLAT_LIST/UNSTRUCTURED]
Changes: + Added Progress Dashboard with jump links + Enhanced [X] status markers + Preserved [Y] completed items + Preserved [Z] pending items + [other changes specific to migration type]

Next steps: 1. Review: diff [backup] .flow/PLAN.md 2. Verify: /flow-status 3. Start using Flow: /flow-brainstorm_start [topic]

üìÇ Flow is now managing this project from .flow/ directory

```

10. **Handle edge cases**:
 - If source file is empty: Suggest `/flow-blueprint` instead
 - If source file is already Flow-compliant: Mention it's already compatible, migrate anyway
 - If can't determine structure: Default to Path C (unstructured)
 - If migration fails: Keep backup safe, report error, suggest manual approach

**Output**: Create `.flow/PLAN.md` from existing documentation, create backup, confirm migration to user.

description: Update existing plan to match latest Flow framework structure
---

You are executing the `/flow-plan-update` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Update an existing `.flow/PLAN.md` to match the latest Flow framework structure and patterns.

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Plan File Template (lines 272-353)
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 105-179 for Framework Structure using Read(offset=105, limit=75)

**IMPORTANT**: This command updates your current plan file to match framework changes (e.g., Progress Dashboard moved, new status markers, structural improvements).

**Instructions**:

1. **Read the framework guide**:

   - Search for DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md in these locations (in order):
     - `.flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `.claude/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `./DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project root)
     - `~/.claude/flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (global)
   - Understand current framework structure and patterns
   - Study the Progress Dashboard template and its location
   - Note all status markers and section structure requirements

2. **Read the example plan**:

   - Search for EXAMPLE_PLAN.md in these locations (in order):
     - `.flow/EXAMPLE_PLAN.md`
     - `.claude/EXAMPLE_PLAN.md`
     - `~/.claude/flow/EXAMPLE_PLAN.md` (global)
   - Study the section order and formatting
   - Note how Progress Dashboard is positioned
   - Understand the complete structure template

3. **Read current plan**:

   - Read `.flow/PLAN.md` (your project's current plan)
   - Analyze its current structure
   - Identify what needs updating to match framework

4. **Create backup**:

   - Copy current plan: `.flow/PLAN.md.version-update-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)`
   - Confirm: "‚úÖ Backed up .flow/PLAN.md to [backup]"

5. **Analyze current plan against framework checklist**:

   **CRITICAL FRAMEWORK VERSION PATTERNS** (v1.2.1+):

   Compare user's PLAN.md against these patterns and identify what needs updating:

   **‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERNS (v1.2.1+)**:

   **A. Section Order**:
   1. Title + Framework Reference header
   2. Overview (Purpose, Goals, Scope)
   3. Progress Dashboard (after Overview, before Architecture)
   4. Architecture
   5. Testing Strategy
   6. Development Plan (Phases ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Iterations)
   7. Changelog

   **B. Implementation Section Pattern** (NO ACTION ITEM DUPLICATION):
   ```markdown
   ### **Implementation - Iteration [N]: [Name]**

   **Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS

   **Action Items**: See resolved subjects above (Type 2/D items)

   **Implementation Notes**:
   [Document progress, discoveries, challenges]

   **Files Modified**:
   - `path/to/file.ts` - Description

   **Verification**: [How verified]
   ```

   **C. Progress Dashboard Jump Links**:
   ```markdown
   **Current Work**:
   - **Phase**: [Phase 2 - Core Implementation](#phase-2-core-implementation-)
   - **Task**: [Task 5 - Error Handling](#task-5-error-handling-)
   - **Iteration**: [Iteration 6 - Circuit Breaker](#iteration-6-circuit-breaker-) üöß IN PROGRESS
   ```

   **D. Iteration Lists** (EXPANDED, not collapsed):
   ```markdown
   - üöß **Task 23**: Refactor Architecture (3/3 iterations)
     - ‚úÖ **Iteration 1**: Separate Concerns - COMPLETE
     - ‚è≥ **Iteration 2**: Extract Logic - PENDING
     - ‚è≥ **Iteration 3**: Optimize - PENDING
   ```

   **E. Status Markers**: ‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ (standardized)

   ---

   **‚ùå DEPRECATED PATTERNS (pre-v1.2.1)**:

   **A. Duplicated Action Items** (REMOVE):
   ```markdown
   ### ‚úÖ Subject 1: Feature X
   **Action Items**:
   - [ ] Item 1
   - [ ] Item 2

   ### **Implementation - Iteration 1**
   **Action Items** (from brainstorming):  ‚Üê DUPLICATE! REMOVE THIS
   - [ ] Item 1
   - [ ] Item 2
   ```
   **FIX**: Replace Implementation action items with "See resolved subjects above"

   **B. Collapsed Iteration Lists** (EXPAND):
   ```markdown
   - üöß Task 23: Architecture (3 iterations total)  ‚Üê WRONG!
   ```
   **FIX**: Expand to show all iterations as sub-bullets

   **C. Duplicate Progress Sections** (REMOVE):
   - Old "Current Phase" headers scattered throughout
   - Multiple "Implementation Tasks" trackers
   - Redundant status summaries
   **FIX**: Single Progress Dashboard after Overview

   **D. Text-based Status Pointers** (REPLACE):
   ```markdown
   Current work: Search for "Current Phase" below  ‚Üê WRONG!
   ```
   **FIX**: Use jump links: `[Progress Dashboard](#-progress-dashboard)`

   **E. Missing Testing Strategy Section** (ADD):
   **FIX**: Add Testing Strategy section (see EXAMPLE_PLAN.md lines 87-129)

6. **Present analysis to user**:

   **DO NOT automatically make changes**. Instead, present findings:

   ```markdown
   ## üìã Plan Structure Analysis

   I've compared your PLAN.md against the latest Flow framework (v1.2.1).

   **‚úÖ Already Correct**:
   - [List patterns that match current framework]

   **‚ùå Needs Updates**:

   1. **Action Item Duplication** (Found in X iterations)
      - Problem: Implementation sections duplicate action items from subjects
      - Fix: Replace with "See resolved subjects above"
      - Saves: ~600-1000 tokens per iteration

   2. **Progress Dashboard Location** (if applicable)
      - Problem: Dashboard is [location]
      - Fix: Move to after Overview, before Architecture

   3. **[Other issues found]**
      - Problem: [description]
      - Fix: [what needs to change]

   **Recommendation**: Should I update your PLAN.md to fix these issues?
   - I'll create a backup first
   - All content will be preserved
   - Only structure/formatting changes
   ```

7. **If user approves, update plan structure** (preserve ALL content):

   **Create backup first**:
   - Copy: `.flow/PLAN.md.version-update-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)`

   **Apply fixes** based on analysis from step 5:
   - Fix action item duplication (replace with references)
   - Move Progress Dashboard to correct location
   - Remove duplicate progress sections
   - Update status pointers to jump links
   - Add missing sections (Testing Strategy, Changelog)
   - Expand collapsed iteration lists
   - Standardize status markers

   **Preserve ALL**:
   - Decisions and rationale
   - Brainstorming subjects and resolutions
   - Implementation notes
   - Completion dates
   - Bug discoveries
   - Code examples

8. **Verify consistency**:

   - Check Progress Dashboard matches status markers
   - Verify all sections follow framework structure
   - Ensure no content was lost

9. **Confirm to user**:
```

‚ú® Plan structure updated to match latest Flow framework!

üíæ Backup: .flow/PLAN.md.version-update-backup-[timestamp]
üéØ Updated: .flow/PLAN.md

Changes made: + Fixed [N] iterations with duplicated action items (replaced with references) + Moved Progress Dashboard to correct location (if needed) + Removed duplicate progress sections (if found) + Updated status pointers to use jump links (if needed) + Added jump links to "Current Work" section (if missing) + Expanded [Y] collapsed iteration lists + Standardized status markers + [other changes specific to this update]

Next steps: 1. Review changes: diff [backup] .flow/PLAN.md 2. Verify: /flow-status 3. Continue work: /flow-next

All your content preserved - only structure enhanced.

```

10. **Handle edge cases**:
- If `.flow/PLAN.md` doesn't exist: Suggest `/flow-blueprint` or `/flow-migrate`
- If plan already matches latest structure: Report "Already up to date!"
- If can't determine what to update: Ask user what framework version they're coming from

**Output**: Update `.flow/PLAN.md` to latest framework structure, create backup, confirm changes to user.

description: Add a new phase to the development plan
---

You are executing the `/flow-phase-add` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Add a new phase to the current PLAN.md file.

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**

- Simple structure addition (adds new phase section to PLAN.md)
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 567-613 for phase patterns

**Context**:

- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)

**üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY RULE**:
If you discover NEW issues while working on this phase that are NOT part of the current work:

1. **STOP** immediately
2. **NOTIFY** user of the new issue
3. **DISCUSS** what to do (add to brainstorm, create pre-task, defer, or handle now)
4. **ONLY** proceed with user's explicit approval

**Instructions**:

1. **INPUT VALIDATION** (Token-Efficient - Run BEFORE reading PLAN.md) ‚ö†Ô∏è UX PRINCIPLE 1 & 2:

   **Goal**: Accept minimal input, use [TBD] for missing metadata - never block for cosmetic reasons.

   **Step 1: Hard Rule Check** (< 10 tokens):
   ```
   IF $ARGUMENTS is empty OR just whitespace:
     REJECT: "‚ùå Missing phase name/description. Example: /flow-phase-add 'Testing and QA'"
     STOP (don't proceed)
   ```

   **Step 2: Accept Everything Else** ‚ö†Ô∏è UX PRINCIPLE 2 (Never Block for Cosmetic Reasons):
   - Even minimal input like "Testing" is OK
   - Will use [TBD] for Strategy and Goal if not inferable
   - Proceed to step 2

2. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

3. **Verify framework understanding**: Know that phases are top-level milestones (e.g., "Foundation", "Core Implementation", "Testing")

4. **Parse arguments and extract metadata**: `$ARGUMENTS` = phase description

   **Extract Strategy and Goal** (if provided in $ARGUMENTS):
   - Example: "Testing Phase | Strategy: Comprehensive QA | Goal: Zero critical bugs"
   - If metadata provided, use it
   - If NOT provided, try to infer from phase name:
     - "Testing" ‚Üí Strategy: "Quality assurance and validation", Goal: "Ensure code quality and stability"
     - "Foundation" ‚Üí Strategy: "Setup and architecture", Goal: "Establish project foundation"
     - "Polish" ‚Üí Strategy: "UX and optimization", Goal: "Production-ready quality"
   - If can't infer (unusual phase name or too vague), use [TBD]:
     - Strategy: "[TBD] - Define strategy during phase start"
     - Goal: "[TBD] - Define goal during phase start"

5. **Add new phase section** ‚ö†Ô∏è UX PRINCIPLE 6 (Honest Communication):

   ```markdown
   ### Phase [N]: [$ARGUMENTS] ‚è≥

   **Strategy**: [Extracted/Inferred/[TBD]]

   **Goal**: [Extracted/Inferred/[TBD]]

   ---
   ```

6. **Update .flow/PLAN.md**: Append new phase to Development Plan section

7. **Update Progress Dashboard** (if it exists):

   - Update phase count in Progress Overview section
   - No need to change "Current Work" pointer (new phase is ‚è≥ PENDING)
   - Add new phase to completion status if tracking percentages

8. **Confirm to user** (show what was used):
   - "‚úÖ Added Phase [N]: [$ARGUMENTS]"
   - IF used [TBD]: "üìù Used [TBD] placeholders for: [Strategy/Goal]"
   - IF inferred metadata: "üí° Inferred: Strategy = '[value]', Goal = '[value]'"
   - "üí° Refine with `/flow-phase-start` when ready to begin"

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with new phase.

You are executing the `/flow-task-start` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Mark the current task as üöß IN PROGRESS (when first iteration starts).

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**
- State transition (‚è≥ PENDING ‚Üí üöß IN PROGRESS)
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 567-613 for lifecycle context

**Context**:
- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)

**üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY RULE**:
If you discover NEW issues while working on this task that are NOT part of the current work:
1. **STOP** immediately
2. **NOTIFY** user of the new issue
3. **DISCUSS** what to do (add to brainstorm, create pre-task, defer, or handle now)
4. **ONLY** proceed with user's explicit approval

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Determine target task** (argument is optional):

   **If task number provided as argument**:
   - Use the specified task number
   - Verify task exists and is ‚è≥ PENDING
   - If not found or not PENDING: "Task [N] not found or not in PENDING state"

   **If no argument provided** (auto-detection):
   - Find current phase (marked üöß IN PROGRESS)
   - Find last ‚úÖ COMPLETE task in that phase
   - Calculate next task number (last complete + 1)
   - Verify next task exists and is ‚è≥ PENDING
   - If not found: List available ‚è≥ PENDING tasks in current phase and ask user to specify
   - Example error: "Cannot auto-detect next task. Available pending tasks in Phase 2: Task 5, Task 7, Task 9. Use `/flow-task-start [number]` to specify."

3. **Update task status**: Change marker from ‚è≥ to üöß IN PROGRESS

4. **Update Progress Dashboard**:
   - Find "## üìã Progress Dashboard" section
   - Update current task information
   - Update last updated timestamp
   - Add action description: "Task [N] started"

5. **Confirm to user**:
   - If argument provided: "‚úÖ Started Task [N]: [Name]"
   - If auto-detected: "‚úÖ Started Task [N]: [Name] (auto-detected next task)"
   - Suggest next steps: "Use `/flow-iteration-add [description]` to create iterations, or `/flow-brainstorm-start [topics]` to brainstorm first."

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with task status change and Progress Dashboard update.

- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Find current task**: Look for task marked üöß IN PROGRESS

3. **Verify all iterations complete**: Check that all iterations in this task are marked ‚úÖ COMPLETE

   - If incomplete iterations found: "Task has incomplete iterations. Complete them first or mark as ‚ùå CANCELLED / üîÆ DEFERRED."

4. **Update task status**: Change marker from üöß to ‚úÖ COMPLETE

5. **Update Progress Dashboard**:

   - Find "## üìã Progress Dashboard" section
   - Update current task to next task (or next phase if all tasks done)
   - Update completion percentages
   - Update last updated timestamp
   - Add action description: "Task [N] complete"

6. **Check if phase complete**:

   - If all tasks in phase are ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Suggest `/flow-phase-complete`
   - If more tasks: Auto-advance to next task (show name)

7. **Show "What's Next" Section**:
   ```markdown
   ## üéØ What's Next

   Task [N]: [Name] marked complete!

   **Decision Tree**:
   - **All tasks in phase complete?** ‚Üí Use `/flow-phase-complete` to mark phase as ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - **More tasks in phase?** ‚Üí Use `/flow-task-start [optional: number]` to begin next task
   - **Want to see current state?** ‚Üí Use `/flow-status` to see suggestions

   **Next task**: Task [N+1]: [Name] (if applicable)
   ```

description: Add a new iteration under the current task
---

You are executing the `/flow-iteration-add` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Add a new iteration to the current task in PLAN.md.

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Iteration Patterns (lines in Quick Reference)
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 567-613 for Development Workflow using Read(offset=567, limit=47)

**üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY RULE**:
If you discover NEW issues while working on this iteration that are NOT part of the current work:

1. **STOP** immediately
2. **NOTIFY** user of the new issue
3. **DISCUSS** what to do (add to brainstorm, create pre-task, defer, or handle now)
4. **ONLY** proceed with user's explicit approval

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Parse arguments**: `$ARGUMENTS` = iteration description

3. **Find current task**: Look for last task marked ‚è≥ or üöß

4. **Add new iteration section**:

   ```markdown
   ##### Iteration [N]: [$ARGUMENTS] ‚è≥

   **Status**: PENDING
   **Goal**: [What this iteration builds]

   ---
   ```
```

5. **Update .flow/PLAN.md**: Append iteration under current task

6. **Update Progress Dashboard** (if it exists):

   **CRITICAL - Read Framework Reference for Iteration List Format**:
   - **Read DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 2555-2567** for CRITICAL iteration list format
   - The framework specifies EXACT format for showing iterations in Progress Dashboard
   - Key rules from framework:
     - Task line shows count: `- üöß **Task 11**: Name Generation (3/5 iterations)`
     - Each iteration MUST be listed as indented sub-bullet with number, name, and status
     - Update both task count AND overall iteration count
   - **DO NOT** write "(X iterations total)" without actually listing them
   - **ALWAYS** expand the task to show full iteration list when adding iterations

7. **Confirm to user**: "Added Iteration [N]: [$ARGUMENTS] to current task. Use `/flow-brainstorm-start [topic]` to begin."

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with new iteration.

description: Start brainstorming session with user-provided topics
---

You are executing the `/flow-brainstorm-start` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Begin a brainstorming session for the current iteration with subjects provided by the user.

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**
- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Subject Resolution Types (lines 108-128), Common Patterns (lines 134-207)
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 1531-2156 for complete Brainstorming Pattern using Read(offset=1531, limit=625)

**Framework Reference**: This command requires framework knowledge to structure brainstorming session correctly. See Quick Reference guide above for essential patterns.

**Signature**: `/flow-brainstorm-start [optional: free-form text describing topics to discuss]`

**Context**:
- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)
- **Framework Pattern**: See "Brainstorming Session Pattern" section in framework guide

**üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY RULE** (CRITICAL - see DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 339-540):

If you discover NEW issues during brainstorming that are NOT part of the current iteration:

1. **STOP** immediately - Don't make assumptions or proceed
2. **NOTIFY** user - Present discovered issue(s) with structured analysis
3. **DISCUSS** - Provide structured options (A/B/C/D format):
   - **A**: Create pre-implementation task (< 30 min work, blocking)
   - **B**: Add as new brainstorming subject (design needed)
   - **C**: Handle immediately (only if user approves)
   - **D**: Defer to separate iteration (after current work)
4. **AWAIT USER APPROVAL** - Never proceed without explicit user decision

**Use the Scope Boundary Alert Template** (see DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 356-390)

**Why This Matters**: User stays in control of priorities, AI finds issues proactively but doesn't make scope decisions

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Find current iteration**: Look for last iteration marked ‚è≥ or üöß

3. **Determine mode** (two modes available):

   **MODE 1: With Argument** (user provides topics in command)
   - User provided topics in `$ARGUMENTS` (free-form text)
   - Parse the user's input and extract individual subjects
   - User controls WHAT to brainstorm, AI structures HOW
   - Example: `/flow-brainstorm-start "API design, database schema, auth flow, error handling"`
   - AI extracts: [API design, database schema, auth flow, error handling]
   - **Proceed to step 4**

   **MODE 2: Without Argument** (interactive) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
   - **NO arguments provided** by user
   - **DO NOT** auto-generate subjects from task description
   - **DO NOT** read PLAN.md and invent subjects automatically
   - **DO NOT** proceed to create brainstorming section yet
   - **STOP and ask the user**:

     Example prompt to user:
     ```
     I'll start a brainstorming session for [Task/Iteration Name].

     **What subjects would you like to discuss?**

     You can provide:
     - Comma-separated topics: "API design, database, auth"
     - Free-form text describing areas to explore
     - Bullet list of specific topics

     Based on the task scope, here are some suggestions:
     - [Suggestion 1 based on task description]
     - [Suggestion 2 based on task description]
     - [Suggestion 3 based on task description]

     Please provide the topics you'd like to brainstorm.
     ```

   - **WAIT for user response** - do NOT proceed without it
   - **After user responds**, extract subjects from their response
   - **Then proceed to step 4**

4. **Extract subjects from user input** (ONLY after user provides topics):
   - Parse natural language text from user's input
   - Identify distinct topics/subjects (comma-separated, "and", bullet points, etc.)
   - Create numbered list
   - Handle 1 to 100+ topics gracefully
   - If ambiguous, ask user for clarification

5. **Update iteration status**: Change to üöß IN PROGRESS (Brainstorming)

6. **Create brainstorming section**:
   ```markdown
   ### **Brainstorming Session - [Brief description from user input]**

   **Focus**: [Summarize the main goal based on subjects]

   **Subjects to Discuss** (tackle one at a time):

   1. ‚è≥ **[Subject 1]** - [Brief description if needed]
   2. ‚è≥ **[Subject 2]** - [Brief description if needed]
   3. ‚è≥ **[Subject 3]** - [Brief description if needed]
   ...

   **Resolved Subjects**:

   ---
```

7. **Update Progress Dashboard**: Update current iteration status to "üöß BRAINSTORMING"

8. **Confirm to user** (only after creating brainstorming section):
   - "Started brainstorming session with [N] subjects."
   - List all subjects
   - "Use `/flow-next-subject` to start discussing the first subject."

**Key Principles**:
- ‚úÖ **User always provides topics** (via argument or when prompted)
- ‚ùå **AI NEVER invents subjects** from task description without user input
- ‚ùå **AI NEVER auto-generates** a subject list when no argument provided
- ‚úÖ **If no argument**: STOP, suggest topics, WAIT for user response
- ‚úÖ **After user provides topics**: THEN create brainstorming section

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with brainstorming section, subject list, and status change (ONLY after user provides topics).

You are executing the `/flow-brainstorm-subject` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Add a new subject to the current brainstorming session.

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**
- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Subject Creation Patterns (lines in Quick Reference)

**üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY RULE** (CRITICAL - see DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 339-540):

Adding subjects dynamically is a KEY feature of Flow. When you discover NEW issues while discussing current subjects:

1. **STOP** immediately - Don't make assumptions or proceed
2. **NOTIFY** user - Present discovered issue(s) with structured analysis
3. **DISCUSS** - Provide structured options (A/B/C/D format):
   - **A**: Create pre-implementation task (< 30 min work, blocking current subject resolution)
   - **B**: Add as new brainstorming subject (this command - design needed)
   - **C**: Handle immediately as part of current subject (only if user approves)
   - **D**: Defer to separate iteration (after current work)
4. **AWAIT USER APPROVAL** - Never proceed without explicit user decision

**Use the Scope Boundary Alert Template** (see DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 356-390)

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Parse arguments**: `$ARGUMENTS` = subject name and optional brief description

3. **Find current brainstorming session**: Look for "Subjects to Discuss" section

4. **Add subject to list**:
   - Count existing subjects
   - Append: `[N]. ‚è≥ **[$ARGUMENTS]** - [Brief description if provided]`

5. **Update .flow/PLAN.md**: Add subject to "Subjects to Discuss" list

6. **Confirm to user**: "Added Subject [N]: [$ARGUMENTS] to brainstorming session."

description: Review all resolved subjects, suggest follow-up work
---

You are executing the `/flow-brainstorm-review` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Review all resolved brainstorming subjects, verify completeness, summarize decisions, show action items, and suggest follow-up work (iterations/pre-tasks) before marking the brainstorming session complete.

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Subject Resolution Types (A/B/C/D) (lines in Quick Reference)
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 1167-1797 for Brainstorming Session Pattern using Read(offset=1167, limit=631)

**This is the review gate before `/flow-brainstorm-complete`.**

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Read framework documentation**: Find and read DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (search in .claude/, project root, or ~/.claude/flow/)

3. **Locate current iteration**: Use "Progress Dashboard" to find current Phase/Task/Iteration

4. **Verify all subjects resolved**:

   - Check "Subjects to Discuss" section under current iteration's "Brainstorming Session"
   - Count total subjects vs ‚úÖ resolved subjects
   - If ANY subjects remain unmarked (‚è≥ PENDING), warn user: "Not all subjects resolved. Run `/flow-next-subject` to complete remaining subjects."
   - If all subjects are ‚úÖ resolved, proceed to next step

5. **Summarize resolved subjects**:

   - Read all entries in "Resolved Subjects" section
   - Create concise summary of each resolution:
     - Subject name
     - Decision made
     - Key rationale points
   - Present in numbered list format

6. **Show all action items**:

   - Extract all documented action items from resolved subjects
   - Categorize by type:
     - **Pre-Implementation Tasks**: Work that must be done BEFORE implementing this iteration
     - **Follow-up Iterations**: Future work to tackle after this iteration
     - **Documentation Updates**: Files/docs that need changes
     - **Other Actions**: Miscellaneous tasks
   - Present in organized format

7. **Categorize action items** (CRITICAL - Ask user to clarify):

   **The 3 Types of Action Items**:

   **Type 1: Pre-Implementation Tasks (Blockers)**
   - Work that MUST be done BEFORE starting main implementation
   - Examples: Refactor legacy code, fix blocking bugs, setup infrastructure
   - These become separate "Pre-Implementation Tasks" section
   - Must be ‚úÖ COMPLETE before running `/flow-implement-start`

   **Type 2: Implementation Work (The Iteration Itself)**
   - The actual work of the current iteration
   - Examples: Command updates, feature additions, new logic
   - These stay as action items IN the iteration description
   - Work on these AFTER running `/flow-implement-start`

   **Type 3: New Iterations (Future Work)**
   - Follow-up work for future iterations
   - Examples: V2 features, optimizations, edge cases discovered
   - Create with `/flow-iteration-add`

   **Decision Tree for AI**:
   - Extract all action items from resolved subjects
   - For each action item, ask yourself:
     - "Does this BLOCK the main work?" ‚Üí Type 1 (Pre-task)
     - "Is this THE main work?" ‚Üí Type 2 (Implementation)
     - "Is this FUTURE work?" ‚Üí Type 3 (New iteration)
   - **If uncertain, ASK THE USER**: "I found these action items. Are they:
     - A) Blockers that must be done first (pre-tasks)
     - B) The implementation work itself
     - C) Future work for new iterations"

   Present categorization in this format:

     ```
     **Pre-Implementation Tasks** (Type 1 - complete before /flow-implement-start):
     - [Task description] - Why it blocks: [reason]

     **Implementation Work** (Type 2 - these ARE the iteration):
     - [Action item 1]
     - [Action item 2]
     (These stay in iteration, work on after /flow-implement-start)

     **New Iterations** (Type 3 - add with /flow-iteration-add):
     - Iteration N+1: [Name] - [Why it's future work]
     ```

8. **Await user confirmation**:
   - Do NOT automatically create iterations or pre-tasks
   - Show categorization above
   - Ask: "Does this categorization look correct? Should I adjust anything?"
   - If user confirms Type 1 (pre-tasks) exist: Ask if they want them created now
   - If user confirms Type 3 (new iterations): Ask if they want them created now
   - Type 2 (implementation work) stays in iteration - no creation needed

9. **Show "What's Next" Section**:
   ```markdown
   ## üéØ What's Next

   **After reviewing**:
   1. If pre-implementation tasks were identified ‚Üí Create them in "Pre-Implementation Tasks" section
   2. If new iterations were suggested ‚Üí Use `/flow-iteration-add` to create each one
   3. Once all pre-tasks are ‚úÖ COMPLETE ‚Üí Run `/flow-brainstorm-complete` to mark iteration üé® READY

   **Decision Tree**:
   - Pre-tasks needed? ‚Üí Create them, complete them, THEN run `/flow-brainstorm-complete`
   - No pre-tasks? ‚Üí Run `/flow-brainstorm-complete` immediately
   - Need more iterations? ‚Üí Use `/flow-iteration-add [description]` first
   ```

**Output**: Comprehensive review summary with actionable suggestions, awaiting user confirmation.

You are executing the `/flow-brainstorm-complete` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Close the current brainstorming session (only after pre-implementation tasks are done).

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Completion Criteria (lines in Quick Reference)
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 1740-1797 for Completion Criteria using Read(offset=1740, limit=58)

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Verify all subjects resolved**: Check "Subjects to Discuss" - all should be ‚úÖ

3. **Check for pre-implementation tasks**:

   - Look for "### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**" section in PLAN.md
   - If found:
     - Check if all pre-tasks are marked ‚úÖ COMPLETE
     - If any are ‚è≥ PENDING or üöß IN PROGRESS:
       "Pre-implementation tasks exist but are not complete. Complete them first, then run this command again."
     - If all are ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Proceed to step 4
   - If not found:
     - Ask user: "Are there any pre-implementation tasks that need to be completed before starting the main implementation? (Refactoring, system-wide changes, bug fixes discovered during brainstorming, etc.)"
     - If yes: "Please document pre-implementation tasks in PLAN.md first (see framework guide), complete them, then run this command again."
     - If no: Proceed to step 4

4. **Update iteration status**: Change from üöß to üé® READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

5. **Add note**: "**Status**: All brainstorming complete, pre-implementation tasks done, ready for implementation"

6. **Show "What's Next" Section**:

description: Begin implementation of current iteration
---

You are executing the `/flow-implement-start` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Begin implementation phase for the current iteration.

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**

- State transition (üé® READY/‚è≥ PENDING ‚Üí üöß IMPLEMENTING)
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1798-1836 for implementation workflow

**Context**:

- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)
- **Framework Pattern**: See "Implementation Pattern" section in framework guide
- **Prerequisite**: Brainstorming must be ‚úÖ COMPLETE and all pre-implementation tasks done

**üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY RULE** (CRITICAL - see DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 339-540):

If you discover NEW issues during implementation that are NOT part of the current iteration's action items:

1. **STOP** immediately - Don't make assumptions or proceed
2. **NOTIFY** user - Present discovered issue(s) with structured analysis
3. **DISCUSS** - Provide structured options (A/B/C/D format):
   - **A**: Create pre-implementation task (< 30 min work, blocking)
   - **B**: Add as new brainstorming subject (design needed)
   - **C**: Handle immediately (only if user approves)
   - **D**: Defer to separate iteration (after current work)
4. **AWAIT USER APPROVAL** - Never proceed without explicit user decision

**Use the Scope Boundary Alert Template** (see DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 356-390)

**Exception**: Syntax errors or blocking bugs in files you must modify (document what you fixed in Implementation Notes)

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Find current iteration**:

   - **First**, look for iteration marked üé® READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
   - **If not found**, check if previous iteration is ‚úÖ COMPLETE and next iteration is ‚è≥ PENDING
     - If YES: Ask user "Previous iteration complete. Do you want to brainstorm this iteration first (recommended) or skip directly to implementation?"
       - **User chooses brainstorm**: Respond "Please run `/flow-brainstorm-start` first to design this iteration"
       - **User chooses skip**: Proceed with step 3 (treat ‚è≥ PENDING as ready to implement)
     - If NO: Error "No iteration ready for implementation. Run `/flow-brainstorm-complete` first or check iteration status."

3. **Read Testing Strategy section** (CRITICAL):

   - Locate "## Testing Strategy" section in PLAN.md
   - Understand the verification methodology (simulation, unit tests, TDD, manual QA, etc.)
   - Note file locations, naming conventions, and when verification happens
   - **IMPORTANT**: Follow Testing Strategy exactly - do NOT create test files that violate conventions

4. **Verify readiness** (if iteration was üé® READY):

   - Brainstorming should be marked ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - All pre-implementation tasks should be ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - If not ready: Warn user and ask to complete brainstorming/pre-tasks first

5. **Update iteration status**: Change from üé® (or ‚è≥ if skipping brainstorm) to üöß IN PROGRESS

6. **Create implementation section**:

   ```markdown
   ### **Implementation - Iteration [N]: [Name]**

   **Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS

   **Action Items**: See resolved subjects above (Type 2/D items)

   **Implementation Notes**:

   [Leave blank for user to fill during implementation]

   **Files Modified**:

   [Leave blank - will be filled as work progresses]

   **Verification**: [Leave blank - how work will be verified]

   ---
   ```

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT copy/duplicate action items from subjects to implementation section. The implementation section REFERENCES subjects where action items are defined. This prevents token waste and maintains single source of truth.
```

7. **Update Progress Dashboard** (if it exists):

   - Update current iteration status to "üöß IMPLEMENTING" or "üöß IN PROGRESS"
   - Update "Last Updated" timestamp
   - Current work pointer should already be correct (pointing to this iteration)

8. **Confirm to user**:
   - If brainstorming was done: "Implementation started! Let's begin with the first action item."
   - If brainstorming was skipped: "Implementation started (brainstorming skipped). Let's begin with the first action item."

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with implementation section, status change, and Dashboard update.

description: Mark current iteration as complete
---

You are executing the `/flow-implement-complete` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Mark the current iteration as complete.

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**
- State transition (üöß IMPLEMENTING ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE)
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1798-1836 for completion criteria

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Find current iteration**: Look for iteration marked üöß IN PROGRESS

3. **Verify completion**:
   - Check all action items are ‚úÖ checked
   - If unchecked items remain: Ask user "There are unchecked action items. Are you sure you want to mark complete? (yes/no)"

4. **Prompt for verification notes**:
   - "How did you verify this iteration works? (tests, manual checks, etc.)"

5. **Update iteration status**: Change from üöß to ‚úÖ COMPLETE

6. **Update implementation section**:
   - Add verification notes
   - Add timestamp

7. **Add completion summary**:
   ```markdown
   **Implementation Results**:
   - [Summarize what was built]
   - [List key accomplishments]

   **Verification**: [User's verification method]

   **Completed**: [Date]
```

8. **Check if task/phase complete**:

   - If all iterations in task complete ‚Üí Mark task ‚úÖ
   - If all tasks in phase complete ‚Üí Mark phase ‚úÖ

9. **Update Progress Dashboard** (if it exists):

   - Update current iteration status to "‚úÖ COMPLETE"
   - Update iteration completion count (e.g., "3/6 complete" ‚Üí "4/6 complete")
   - If moving to next iteration: Update "Current Work" pointer to next ‚è≥ PENDING iteration
   - If task/phase complete: Update those statuses as well
   - Update "Last Updated" timestamp
   - Update completion percentages if tracked

10. **Show "What's Next" Section**:
    ```markdown
    ## üéØ What's Next

    Iteration [N] marked complete!

    **Decision Tree**:
    - **More iterations planned?** ‚Üí Use `/flow-iteration-add [description]` to create next iteration
    - **Task complete (all iterations done)?** ‚Üí Use `/flow-task-complete` to mark task as ‚úÖ COMPLETE
    - **Not sure what's next?** ‚Üí Use `/flow-status` to see current state and suggestions
    - **Want to see full project status?** ‚Üí Use `/flow-summarize` for complete overview

    **Current state**: [Show iteration count, e.g., "3/5 iterations complete" OR "All iterations complete - task ready to close"]
    ```

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with completion status, summary, Dashboard update, and clear next-step guidance.

description: Show current position and verify plan consistency
---

You are executing the `/flow-status` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Show current position in the plan and verify active work consistency.

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**
- Dashboard-first approach using grep-based pattern matching
- Reduces token usage by 95% (from 32,810 ‚Üí ~1,530 tokens for large files)
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 2015-2314 for dashboard structure reference

**PERFORMANCE NOTE**: This is the reference model for Category B commands - uses targeted greps instead of reading entire framework.

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Read Progress Dashboard ONLY** (Dashboard-first approach):
   ```bash
   # Use Grep to read ONLY the Progress Dashboard section (~50 lines)
   Grep pattern: "^## üìã Progress Dashboard"
   Use -A 20 flag to read ~20 lines after match
```

Extract from Dashboard text:

- Last Updated timestamp
- Current Phase number and name
- Current Task number and name
- Current Iteration number and name
- Current status (‚è≥ PENDING / üöß IMPLEMENTING / üé® READY / etc)
- Completion percentages

3.  **Verify current markers** (micro integrity - current work only):

    Use 3 targeted Greps to verify ONLY the current items claimed by Dashboard:

    **Grep 1 - Verify Current Phase**:

    ```bash
    # If Dashboard says "Phase 2", verify Phase 2 marker
    pattern: "^### Phase 2:"
    Use -A 2 to read status line
    Extract: Status emoji (‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚úÖ ‚ùå üîÆ)
    ```

    **Grep 2 - Verify Current Task**:

    ```bash
    # If Dashboard says "Task 4", verify Task 4 marker
    pattern: "^#### Task 4:"
    Use -A 2 to read status line
    Extract: Status emoji
    ```

    **Grep 3 - Verify Current Iteration**:

    ```bash
    # If Dashboard says "Iteration 6", verify Iteration 6 marker
    pattern: "^##### Iteration 6:"
    Use -A 2 to read status line
    Extract: Status emoji
    ```

    **Grep 4 - Check for Pre-Implementation Tasks**:

    ```bash
    # Check if current iteration has pre-implementation tasks
    pattern: "^### \*\*Pre-Implementation Tasks:\*\*$"
    Search within current iteration scope

    If found:
      Count pending: grep -c "^#### ‚è≥ Task [0-9]"
      Count complete: grep -c "^#### ‚úÖ Task [0-9]"
      Extract task names and numbers for reporting

    Use awk to scope search to current iteration:
    awk '/^##### Iteration X\.Y:.*üöß/,/^#####[^#]|^####[^#]/ {print}' PLAN.md
    ```

    **Grep 5 - Check Unresolved Brainstorming Subjects**:

    ```bash
    # Check if iteration has unresolved subjects
    Extract "Subjects to Discuss" section:
    awk '/\*\*Subjects to Discuss\*\*:/,/\*\*Resolved Subjects\*\*:/ {print}'

    Count unresolved: grep -c "^[0-9]\+\. ‚è≥"

    If any unresolved:
      Extract subject names for reporting
    ```

4.  **Micro integrity check** (active work only):

    - Compare Dashboard claims vs actual markers for current phase/task/iteration
    - **Skip all ‚úÖ COMPLETE items** - Already verified, now frozen
    - Report verification results:

      ```
      üîç Consistency Check (Current Work Only):

      ‚úÖ Phase 2 marker: üöß IN PROGRESS ‚úì
      ‚úÖ Task 4 marker: üöß IN PROGRESS ‚úì
      ‚úÖ Iteration 6 marker: üöß IMPLEMENTING ‚úì

      Status: Dashboard aligned with markers ‚úì
      ```

5.  **If inconsistency detected**:

    ```
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  INCONSISTENCY DETECTED:

    Dashboard claims: Iteration 6 üöß IMPLEMENTING
    Actual marker:    Iteration 6 ‚è≥ PENDING

    Action: Update Progress Dashboard to match markers
    (Status markers are ground truth, Dashboard is pointer)
    ```

6.  **Display current position**:

    ```
    üìã Current Position:

    Phase [N]: [Name] [Status]
      ‚îî‚îÄ Task [N]: [Name] [Status]
          ‚îî‚îÄ Iteration [N]: [Name] [Status]

    üîç Current Phase: [Detailed phase description]

    [If in brainstorming with unresolved subjects:]
    - Brainstorming subjects: ‚è≥ In progress (X/Y resolved)
      - ‚è≥ Subject Name 1
      - ‚è≥ Subject Name 2

    [If in brainstorming with pre-tasks:]
    - Brainstorming subjects: ‚úÖ All resolved
    - Pre-implementation tasks: ‚è≥ In progress (X/Y complete)
      - ‚úÖ Task 1: Name
      - ‚è≥ Task 2: Name (NEXT)
      - ‚è≥ Task 3: Name

    Last Updated: [Timestamp from Dashboard]
    ```

7.  **Suggest next action** (comprehensive decision tree):

    **Step 1: Check task status first**

    **If current task is ‚úÖ COMPLETE**:
    ‚Üí "Task complete! Use `/flow-task-start` [optional: task number] to begin next task"
    ‚Üí Display next pending task if available: "Next: Task [N]: [Name]"
    ‚Üí If all tasks in phase complete: "All tasks complete! Use `/flow-phase-complete` to mark phase done"

    **Step 2: Check iteration status marker**

    **If ‚è≥ PENDING**:
    ‚Üí "Use `/flow-brainstorm-start [topics]` to begin brainstorming"

    **If üöß IN PROGRESS**:
    **Step 3: Determine which phase** (check in this order):

    A. **Check for unresolved subjects** (from Grep 5):
    If unresolved subjects exist:
    ‚Üí "Continue with `/flow-next-subject` to resolve next subject"
    Display: Show count and list unresolved subject names

    B. **Check for pre-implementation tasks** (from Grep 4):
    If pre-tasks section exists:
    Count pending pre-tasks

         If any pending (‚è≥):
           ‚Üí "Continue with Task X: [Name]" (show next pending pre-task)
           Display: "Pre-implementation tasks: [X/Y] complete"

         If all complete (‚úÖ):
           ‚Üí "Pre-implementation tasks complete. Use `/flow-brainstorm-complete` to mark brainstorming done"

    C. **Check for Implementation section**:
    If "### **Implementation**" section exists:
    ‚Üí "Continue main implementation. Use `/flow-implement-complete` when done"

    D. **Default** (subjects resolved, no pre-tasks, no implementation yet):
    ‚Üí "Use `/flow-brainstorm-complete` to finish brainstorming"

    **If üé® READY**:
    ‚Üí "Use `/flow-implement-start` to begin implementation"

    **If ‚úÖ COMPLETE**:
    ‚Üí "Use `/flow-iteration-add [description]` to start next iteration"

8.  **Show completion summary** (from Dashboard percentages):
    - Display Phase completion percentage
    - Display Task completion percentage
    - Display overall project completion

**Key Differences from `/flow-summarize`**:

- `/flow-status` = **Micro scope** (current work only, ~1,530 tokens)
- `/flow-summarize` = **Macro scope** (entire project tree, higher token usage)
- Both verify integrity at their respective scopes

**Output**: Display current position, micro verification results, next action suggestion.

description: Generate summary of all phases/tasks/iterations
---

You are executing the `/flow-summarize` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Generate high-level overview of entire project structure and completion state.

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**
- Uses PLAN.md structure only (no framework knowledge needed)
- Parses all phases/tasks/iterations with status markers
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 105-179 for hierarchy context

**Context**:
- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)
- **Use case**: "Bird's eye view" of project health, progress across all phases, quick status reports

**Comparison to other commands**:
- `/flow-status` = "Where am I RIGHT NOW?" (micro view - current iteration)
- `/flow-summarize` = "What's the WHOLE PICTURE?" (macro view - all phases/tasks/iterations)
- `/flow-verify-plan` = "Is this accurate?" (validation)
- `/flow-compact` = "Transfer full context" (comprehensive handoff)

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Parse entire PLAN.md structure**:
   - Extract Version (from metadata at top)
   - Extract current Status line (from metadata)
   - Parse ALL phases with their status markers
   - For each phase, parse ALL tasks
   - For each task, parse ALL iterations
   - Track completion percentages at each level

3. **Generate structured summary** (compact, scannable format):

```

üìä Flow Summary

Version: [V1/V2/V3]
Status: [Current phase/task/iteration from metadata]

Phase [N]: [Name] [Status] [%]

- Task [N]: [Name] [Status]
  - Iter [N-N] [Status]: [Concise description]
  - Iter [N] üöß CURRENT: [What you're working on]
  - Iter [N] ‚è≥: [What's next]

Phase [N]: [Name] [Status] [%]

- Task [N-N]: [Grouped if similar] [Status]
- Task [N]: [Name] [Status]

Deferred to V2:

- [Iteration/feature name]
- [Iteration/feature name]

---

TL;DR: [One punchy sentence about overall state]

```

4. **Formatting rules**:
- **Compact**: Group consecutive completed iterations (e.g., "Iter 1-5 ‚úÖ")
- **Scannable**: Use emojis (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé®) and percentages prominently
- **Highlight**: Mark CURRENT work explicitly in bold or with flag
- **Indent**: Phase (no indent), Task (- prefix), Iteration (-- or nested -)
- **Defer section**: Show V2/future items at bottom
- **Skip noise**: Don't list every task name if they're obvious/sequential
- **Focus on active work**: Emphasize in-progress and next items

5. **Example output** (payment gateway):

```

üìä Flow Summary

Version: V1
Status: Phase 2, Task 5, Iteration 2 - In Progress

Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ 100%

- Task 1-2: Setup, API, Database schema ‚úÖ

Phase 2: Core Implementation üöß 75%

- Task 3-4: Payment processing, Webhooks ‚úÖ
- Task 5: Error Handling
  - Iter 1 ‚úÖ: Retry logic
  - Iter 2 üöß CURRENT: Circuit breaker
  - Iter 3 ‚è≥: Dead letter queue

Phase 3: Testing & Integration ‚è≥ 0%

- Task 6: Integration tests (pending)

Deferred to V2:

- Advanced features (monitoring, metrics)
- Name generation

---

TL;DR: Foundation done, core payment flow working, currently building circuit breaker for error handling.

```

**Example output** (RED project - showing V1/V2 split):

```

üìä Flow Summary - RED Ability Generation

=== V1 - Core System ===

Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ 100%

- Task 1-4: Constants, enums, types, refactoring ‚úÖ

Phase 2: Core Implementation üöß 85%

- Iter 1-5 ‚úÖ: Tier gen, slots, filtering, selection, template parsing
- Iter 6 üöß NEXT: Green.generate() integration (ties everything together)
- Iter 7 ‚è≥: Blue validation (input guards)
- Iter 9 ‚è≥ LAST: Red API wrapper (exposes Blue ‚Üí Green)

Phase 3: Testing

- Script-based testing (Blue ‚Üí Green flow)

Deferred to V2:

- Iter 8: Name generation (stub returns "Generated Ability")
- Database persistence
- Stats-based damage calculations

=== V2 - Enhanced System (Phase 4) ===

Enhancements:

- Potency system (stats √ó formulas replace fixed damage)
- Name generation (124 weighted prefix/suffix combos)
- 12 new placeholders (conditionals, resources, targeting)
- Damage variance (¬±10% for crits)
- Points & Luck systems
- Database persistence

---

TL;DR:
V1 = Basic working system with hardcoded damage ranges (85% done, integration next)
V2 = Dynamic formulas, character stats integration, full feature set

```

6. **Add deferred/cancelled sections**:
```

üîÆ Deferred Items:

- Iteration 10: Name Generation (V2 - complexity, needs 124 components)
- Task 12: Advanced Features (V2 - out of V1 scope)
- Feature X: Multi-provider support (V3 - abstraction layer)

‚ùå Cancelled Items:

- Task 8: Custom HTTP Client (rejected - SDK is better)
- Subject 3: GraphQL API (rejected - REST is sufficient)

```

7. **Smart verification** (active work only):
- Skip ‚úÖ COMPLETE items (verified & frozen)
- Verify üöß ‚è≥ üé® items match Progress Dashboard
- Check ‚ùå items have reasons
- Check üîÆ items have reasons + destinations
- Report:
  ```
  üîç Verification (Active Work Only):
  ‚úÖ All active markers (üöß ‚è≥) match Progress Dashboard
  ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped 18 completed items (verified & frozen)
  ```

8. **Handle multiple versions**:
- If PLAN.md has V2/V3 sections, use `=== V1 Summary ===` separator
- V1 gets full Phase/Task/Iteration breakdown
- V2+ get high-level "Enhancements" list (not full iteration tree)
- Separate TL;DR line for each version

9. **After generating summary**:
- "Use `/flow-status` to see detailed current position"
- "Use `/flow-verify-plan` to verify accuracy against actual code"

**Manual alternative**:
- Read entire PLAN.md manually
- Create outline of all phases/tasks/iterations
- Count completions and calculate percentages
- Format into hierarchical view

**Output**: Hierarchical summary of entire project structure with completion tracking.

**File**: `flow-next-subject.md`

```markdown
---
description: Discuss next subject, capture decision, and mark resolved
---

You are executing the `/flow-next-subject` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Show next unresolved subject, present options collaboratively, wait for user decision, then mark as ‚úÖ resolved.

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Subject Resolution Types (lines 108-132) - Types A/B/C/D decision matrix
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 1570-1680 for Subject Resolution details using Read(offset=1570, limit=110)

**Framework Reference**: This command requires framework knowledge to properly categorize resolution types. See Quick Reference guide above for essential patterns.

**üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY RULE** (CRITICAL - see DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 339-540):

If you discover NEW issues while discussing subjects that are NOT part of the current iteration:

1. **STOP** immediately - Don't make assumptions or proceed
2. **NOTIFY** user - Present discovered issue(s) with structured analysis
3. **DISCUSS** - Provide structured options (A/B/C/D format):
   - **A**: Create pre-implementation task (< 30 min work, blocking)
   - **B**: Add as new brainstorming subject (design needed)
   - **C**: Handle immediately (only if user approves)
   - **D**: Defer to separate iteration (after current work)
4. **AWAIT USER APPROVAL** - Never proceed without explicit user decision

**Use the Scope Boundary Alert Template** (see DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 356-390)

**Why This Matters**: User stays in control of priorities. AI finds issues proactively but doesn't make scope decisions.

**New Collaborative Workflow** (two-phase approach):
```

Phase 1 (Present):
/flow-next-subject ‚Üí present subject + options ‚Üí ask user ‚Üí üõë STOP & WAIT

Phase 2 (Capture - triggered by user response):
User responds ‚Üí capture decision ‚Üí document ‚Üí mark ‚úÖ ‚Üí auto-advance to next

```

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Find current brainstorming session**: Look for "Subjects to Discuss" section

3. **Find first unresolved subject**: Look for first ‚è≥ subject in the list

4. **If found** (subject needs discussion):

   **Step A: Present subject**
   - Display subject name and description
   - Present relevant context from iteration goal
   - **DO NOT read codebase files**
   - **DO NOT analyze existing implementation**
   - **DO NOT create detailed solutions**
   - Keep it brief - this is just presenting the topic

   **Step B: Present options and STOP** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
   - **DO NOT research code** before presenting options
   - **DO NOT read files** to understand current implementation
   - **DO NOT create detailed architecture diagrams**
   - Suggest 2-4 high-level options/approaches based on GENERAL knowledge
   - Present each option with brief pros/cons (1-2 sentences each)
   - Format as numbered list for clarity
   - Include option for "Your own approach"
   - Ask user explicitly: "Which option do you prefer? Or provide your own approach."
   - **üõë STOP HERE - Wait for user response (do NOT proceed to capture decision)**
   - **DO NOT** decide on behalf of user
   - **DO NOT** document any decision yet
   - **DO NOT** create massive detailed resolutions
   - Command execution ends here - user will respond in next message

   **Step C: Capture user's decision** (only execute AFTER user responds)
   - Read user's response from their message
   - If decision is clear: proceed to document it
   - If unclear: ask clarifying questions
   - If rationale not provided: ask "What's your reasoning for this choice?"
   - Optional: "Any action items to track for this decision?"
   - **KEEP DOCUMENTATION CONCISE** (1-3 paragraphs, not 336 lines!)
   - **NO massive architecture diagrams** unless user explicitly provides one
   - **NO detailed implementation plans** - save for implementation phase
   - Capture: Decision + Rationale + Action Items (if any)

   **Step D: Document resolution**
   - Mark subject ‚úÖ in "Subjects to Discuss" list
   - Add **CONCISE** resolution section under "Resolved Subjects":
     ```markdown
     ### ‚úÖ **Subject [N]: [Name]**

     **Decision**: [User's decision from their response - 1-2 sentences]

     **Rationale**:
     - [Reason 1 from user or follow-up]
     - [Reason 2]

     **Action Items** (if any):
     - [ ] [Item 1 - brief, not detailed implementation steps]
     - [ ] [Item 2]

     ---
     ```
   - **Example of TOO MUCH**: 336 line resolution with interfaces, diagrams, detailed architecture
   - **Example of GOOD**: 10-20 line resolution with decision, rationale, 3-5 action items

   **Step E: Auto-advance OR prompt for review**
   - Update PLAN.md with resolution
   - Show progress: "[N] of [Total] subjects resolved"
   - Check if more ‚è≥ subjects exist:
     - **If YES** (more pending): Auto-show next unresolved subject
     - **If NO** (all resolved): Show workflow prompt below

5. **If all resolved** (this was the last subject):
   - **Show brief summary** of decisions made
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - Show "What's Next" Section (MANDATORY - AI MUST NOT SKIP THIS)**:
     ```markdown
     ‚úÖ All subjects resolved!

     ## üéØ What's Next

     **REQUIRED NEXT STEP**: Run `/flow-brainstorm-review` to:
     - Analyze all resolved subjects
     - Categorize action items (pre-tasks vs implementation vs new iterations)
     - Generate follow-up work suggestions
     - Prepare for implementation

     **DO NOT run `/flow-brainstorm-complete` yet** - review comes first!

     **Workflow Reminder**:
     1. ‚úÖ NOW: `/flow-brainstorm-review` (analyze & suggest)
     2. THEN: Create any pre-tasks if needed
     3. THEN: Complete pre-tasks (if any)
     4. FINALLY: `/flow-brainstorm-complete` (mark üé® READY)

     **Why this order matters**: Review identifies blockers (pre-tasks) that must be done before implementation starts.
     ```
   - **AI BEHAVIOR**: Do NOT suggest `/flow-brainstorm-complete` or any other command. The "What's Next" section MUST explicitly guide to `/flow-brainstorm-review` first.

**Key Principle**: Moving to next subject implies current is resolved. No separate "resolve" command needed.

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with subject resolution and show next subject.

description: Show next iteration details
---

You are executing the `/flow-next-iteration` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Display details about the next pending iteration in the current task.

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**

- Finds next ‚è≥ PENDING iteration in current task
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 567-613 for iteration context

**Pattern**: Works like `/flow-next-subject` but for iterations - shows what's coming next.

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Find current task**: Look for task marked üöß IN PROGRESS

3. **Find next pending iteration**: Look for first iteration in current task marked ‚è≥ PENDING

4. **If found, display iteration details**:
```

üìã Next Iteration:

**Iteration [N]**: [Name]

**Goal**: [What this iteration builds]

**Status**: ‚è≥ PENDING

**Approach**: [Brief description from iteration section if available]

---

Ready to start? Use `/flow-brainstorm-start [topic]` to begin.

```

5. **If NOT found (no pending iterations)**:
- Check if current iteration is in progress: "Still working on Iteration [N]: [Name]. Use `/flow-implement-complete` when done."
- Otherwise: "No more iterations in current task. Use `/flow-iteration-add [description]` to create next iteration, or `/flow-task-complete` if task is done."

6. **Show progress**: "Iteration [current] of [total] in current task"

**Output**: Display next iteration details and suggest appropriate next action.

description: Smart helper - suggests next action based on current context
---

You are executing the `/flow-next` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Auto-detect current context and suggest the next logical step.

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**

- Smart navigation using Dashboard and current context
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 3277-3356 for decision tree reference

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Determine current context**:

   - Check current iteration status (‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚úÖ)
   - Check if in brainstorming session:
     - Look for "Subjects to Discuss" section
     - Count unresolved subjects: grep -c "^[0-9]\+\. ‚è≥"
   - Check for pre-implementation tasks:
     - Look for "### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**" section
     - Count pending: grep -c "^#### ‚è≥ Task [0-9]"
     - Count complete: grep -c "^#### ‚úÖ Task [0-9]"
   - Check if in main implementation (look for "### **Implementation**" section)

3. **Suggest next command based on context**:

   **Determine exact state**:

   **If status = ‚è≥ PENDING**:
   ‚Üí "Use `/flow-brainstorm-start [topic]` to begin this iteration"

   **If status = üöß IN PROGRESS**:
   **Check phase progression** (in this order):

   1. **Check unresolved subjects**:
      If any "‚è≥" subjects in "Subjects to Discuss":
      ‚Üí "Use `/flow-next-subject` to resolve next subject"
      Show: "X subjects remaining: [list]"

   2. **Check pre-implementation tasks**:
      If "### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**" section exists:
      Count pending tasks (^#### ‚è≥)

      If pending > 0:
      ‚Üí "Continue with Task X: [Name]"
      Show: "[X/Y] pre-implementation tasks complete"

      If pending = 0:
      ‚Üí "Pre-implementation complete. Use `/flow-brainstorm-complete`"

   3. **Check main implementation**:
      If "### **Implementation**" section exists:
      ‚Üí "Continue main implementation"
      Show: "Use `/flow-implement-complete` when done"

   4. **Default** (subjects resolved, no pre-tasks):
      ‚Üí "Use `/flow-brainstorm-complete` to finish brainstorming"

   **If status = üé® READY**:
   ‚Üí "Use `/flow-implement-start` to begin implementation"

   **If status = ‚úÖ COMPLETE**:
   ‚Üí "Use `/flow-next-iteration` to move to next iteration"

4. **Show current status summary**: Brief summary of where you are

**Output**: Suggest appropriate next command based on context.

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Check if rollback is possible**:

   - Look for "Changelog" section at bottom of PLAN.md
   - If no recent changes logged: "No recent changes to rollback."

3. **Identify last change**:

   - Parse last entry in Changelog
   - Determine what was changed (phase added, task marked complete, etc.)

4. **Ask for confirmation**:

   - "Last change: [Description of change]. Rollback? (yes/no)"

5. **If confirmed, revert change**:

   - Remove last added section, OR
   - Change status marker back to previous state, OR
   - Uncheck last checked checkbox

6. **Update Changelog**: Add rollback entry

7. **Confirm to user**: "Rolled back: [Description of change]"

**Limitation**: Can only rollback one step at a time. For major reverts, manually edit PLAN.md.

**Output**: Revert last change in PLAN.md.

description: Verify plan file matches actual codebase state
---

You are executing the `/flow-verify-plan` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Verify that PLAN.md is synchronized with the actual project state.

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Framework Structure validation (lines in Quick Reference)
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 105-179 for Framework Structure using Read(offset=105, limit=75)

**Context**:

- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)
- **Use case**: Run before starting new AI session or compacting conversation to ensure context is accurate

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Find current iteration**: Look for iteration marked üöß IN PROGRESS or üé® READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

3. **Read current implementation section**:

   - Find "Implementation - Iteration [N]" section
   - Identify all action items
   - Note which items are marked as ‚úÖ complete

4. **Verify claimed completions against actual project state**:

   - For each ‚úÖ completed action item, check if it actually exists:
     - "Create UserAuth.ts" ‚Üí Verify file exists
     - "Add login endpoint" ‚Üí Search for login endpoint in code
     - "Update database schema" ‚Üí Check schema files
   - List any discrepancies found

5. **Check for unreported work**:

   - Look for modified files that aren't mentioned in PLAN.md
   - Check git status (if available) for uncommitted changes
   - Identify files that were changed but not documented

6. **Report findings**:
```

üìã Plan Verification Results:

‚úÖ Verified Complete:

- [List action items that are correctly marked complete]

‚ùå Discrepancies Found:

- [List action items marked complete but evidence not found]

üìù Unreported Work:

- [List files changed but not mentioned in PLAN.md]

Status: [SYNCHRONIZED / NEEDS UPDATE]

```

7. **If discrepancies found**:
- Ask user: "PLAN.md is out of sync with project state. Update .flow/PLAN.md now? (yes/no)"
- If yes: Update .flow/PLAN.md to reflect actual state:
  - Uncheck items that aren't actually done
  - Add notes about files modified
  - Update status markers if needed
- If no: "Review discrepancies above and update PLAN.md manually."

8. **If synchronized**:
- "PLAN.md is synchronized with project state. Ready to continue work."

**Manual alternative**:
- Review PLAN.md action items manually
- Check each completed item exists in codebase
- Use `git status` and `git diff` to verify changes
- Update .flow/PLAN.md to match reality

**Output**: Verification report and optional PLAN.md updates.

**File**: `flow-compact.md`

```markdown
You are executing the `/flow-compact` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive conversation report for context transfer to new AI instance.

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**

- Generates comprehensive report using PLAN.md content and `/flow-status` logic
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 2327-2362 for context preservation patterns

**Context**:

- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)
- **Use case**: Before compacting conversation or starting new AI session - ensures zero context loss

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Run status verification first**:

   - Execute `/flow-status` command logic to verify current position
   - Check for conflicting status sections (warn if found)
   - Use this verified status as authoritative source for the report

3. **Generate comprehensive report covering**:

   **Current Work Context**:

   - What feature/task are we working on?
   - What phase/task/iteration are we in? (with status)
   - What was the original goal?

   **Conversation History**:

   - What decisions were made during brainstorming? (with rationale)
   - What subjects were discussed and resolved?
   - What pre-implementation tasks were identified and completed?
   - What action items were generated?

   **Implementation Progress**:

   - What has been implemented so far?
   - What files were created/modified?
   - What verification was done?
   - What remains incomplete?

   **Challenges & Solutions**:

   - What blockers were encountered?
   - How were they resolved?
   - What design trade-offs were made?

   **Next Steps**:

   - What is the immediate next action?
   - What are the pending action items?
   - What should the next AI instance focus on?

   **Important Context**:

   - Any quirks or special considerations for this feature
   - Technical constraints or dependencies
   - User preferences or decisions that must be preserved

4. **Report format**:
```

# Context Transfer Report

## Generated: [Date/Time]

## Current Status

[Phase/Task/Iteration with status markers]

## Feature Overview

[What we're building and why]

## Conversation Summary

[Chronological summary of discussions and decisions]

## Implementation Progress

[What's done, what's in progress, what's pending]

## Key Decisions & Rationale

[Critical decisions made with reasoning]

## Files Modified

[List with brief description of changes]

## Challenges Encountered

[Problems and how they were solved]

## Next Actions

[Immediate next steps for new AI instance]

## Critical Context

[Must-know information for continuation]

```

5. **Important guidelines**:
- **Do NOT include generic project info** (tech stack, architecture overview, etc.)
- **Focus ENTIRELY on the feature at hand** and this conversation
- **Do NOT worry about token output length** - comprehensive is better than brief
- **Include WHY, not just WHAT** - decisions need context
- **Be specific** - reference exact file names, function names, line numbers
- **Preserve user preferences** - if user made specific choices, document them

6. **After generating report**:
- "Context transfer report generated. Copy this report to a new AI session to continue work with zero context loss."
- "Use `/flow-verify-plan` before starting new session to ensure PLAN.md is synchronized."

**Manual alternative**:
- Read entire conversation history manually
- Summarize key points, decisions, and progress
- Document in separate notes file
- Reference PLAN.md for structure

**Output**: Comprehensive context transfer report.

description: Archive old completed tasks to reduce PLAN.md size
---

You are executing the `/flow-plan-split` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Archive old completed tasks outside the recent context window to `.flow/ARCHIVE.md`, reducing PLAN.md size while preserving full project history.

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**

- Archives completed tasks to ARCHIVE.md (keeps recent 3 tasks in PLAN.md)
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 2363-2560 for archival patterns

**Context**:

- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)
- **Archive File**: .flow/ARCHIVE.md (created/appended)

**When to Use**: When PLAN.md exceeds 2000 lines or has 10+ completed tasks, causing performance issues or difficult navigation.

**Archiving Strategy - Recent Context Window**:

- **Keep in PLAN.md**: Current task + 3 previous tasks (regardless of status)
- **Archive to ARCHIVE.md**: All ‚úÖ COMPLETE tasks older than "current - 3"
- **Always Keep**: Non-complete tasks (‚è≥ üöß ‚ùå üîÆ) regardless of age

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Find current task number**:

   - Read Progress Dashboard to identify current task
   - Extract task number (e.g., if "Task 13" is current, task number = 13)

3. **Calculate archiving threshold**:

   - Threshold = Current task number - 3
   - Example: Current = 13, Threshold = 10
   - **Archive candidates**: Tasks 1-9 (if ‚úÖ COMPLETE)
   - **Keep in PLAN.md**: Tasks 10, 11, 12, 13 (current + 3 previous)

4. **Extract archivable tasks**:

   - Find all tasks with number < threshold AND status = ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - Extract FULL task content:
     - Task header and metadata
     - All iterations (brainstorming, implementation, verification)
     - All nested content
   - **IMPORTANT**: Keep tasks that are ‚ùå ‚è≥ üöß üîÆ even if old (incomplete work stays visible)

5. **Create or append to ARCHIVE.md**:

   **If .flow/ARCHIVE.md does NOT exist** (first split):

   ```markdown
   # Project Archive

   This file contains completed tasks that have been archived from PLAN.md to reduce file size.

   **Archive Info**:

   - All content preserved (nothing deleted)
   - Organized by Phase ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Iteration
   - Reference: See PLAN.md Progress Dashboard for full project history

   **Last Updated**: [Current date]
   **Tasks Archived**: [Count]

   ---

   [Archived task content here - preserve phase structure]
   ```
```

**If .flow/ARCHIVE.md ALREADY exists** (subsequent split):

- Read existing ARCHIVE.md
- Update "Last Updated" and "Tasks Archived" count
- Append new archived tasks to appropriate phase sections
- Maintain phase hierarchy (don't duplicate phase headers if they exist)

6. **Update PLAN.md**:

   **A. Remove archived task content**:

   - Delete full task sections for archived tasks from Development Plan
   - Preserve phase headers (even if all tasks archived)

   **B. Update Progress Dashboard**:

   - Add üì¶ marker to archived tasks
   - Format: `- ‚úÖüì¶ Task 5: Feature Name (archived)`
   - Keep full project history visible in Progress Overview

   **C. Update phase headers** (if all tasks archived):

   ```markdown
   ### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ

   **Status**: COMPLETE (tasks archived)
   **Completed**: [Date]
   **Tasks**: [Count] tasks (üì¶ archived)
   ```

7. **Verify and confirm**:

   - Count lines before/after (use `wc -l`)
   - Calculate reduction: `before - after = saved lines`
   - Confirm to user:

     ```
     ‚úÖ Plan split complete!

     **Archived**: X tasks to .flow/ARCHIVE.md
     **PLAN.md size**: Reduced from Y lines to Z lines (-W lines, -P%)
     **Recent context**: Kept Task [threshold] through Task [current]

     Your Progress Dashboard still shows complete project history.
     Archived content available in .flow/ARCHIVE.md
     ```

**Edge Cases**:

- **No old completed tasks**: "No tasks to archive. All completed tasks are within recent context window (current + 3 previous)."
- **Current task < 4**: "Current task is Task [N]. Need at least Task 4 to enable archiving (keeps current + 3 previous)."
- **Non-complete old tasks**: Keep them in PLAN.md with note: "Task [N] kept in PLAN.md (not complete - status: [status])"

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md (reduced) and create/append .flow/ARCHIVE.md (full history preserved).

description: Move task(s) to backlog to reduce active plan clutter
---

You are executing the `/flow-backlog-add` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Move pending tasks from PLAN.md to BACKLOG.md to reduce active plan size while preserving all task context (iterations, brainstorming, everything).

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md**

- Moves full task content to backlog (token efficiency feature)
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 3407-3682 for backlog management patterns

**Context**:

- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)
- **Backlog File**: .flow/BACKLOG.md (created/updated)

**Key Insight**: Backlog is for **token efficiency**, not prioritization. Tasks aren't "low priority" - they're just "not now" (weeks/months away).

**Signature**: `/flow-backlog-add <task-number>` or `/flow-backlog-add <start>-<end>`

**Examples**:
- `/flow-backlog-add 14` - Move Task 14 to backlog
- `/flow-backlog-add 14-22` - Move Tasks 14 through 22 to backlog

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Parse arguments**:
   - Single task: `$ARGUMENTS` = task number (e.g., "14")
   - Range: `$ARGUMENTS` = start-end (e.g., "14-22")
   - Extract task number(s) to move

3. **Validate tasks**:
   - Verify each task exists in PLAN.md
   - Check task status - warn if moving tasks that are üöß IN PROGRESS or ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - Recommended: Only move ‚è≥ PENDING tasks
   - If user confirms moving non-pending tasks, proceed

4. **Extract full task content from PLAN.md**:
   - For each task number, extract COMPLETE task section:
     - Task header: `#### Task [N]: [Name] [Status]`
     - All task metadata (Status, Purpose, etc.)
     - ALL iterations (full content with brainstorming, implementation, verification)
     - ALL nested content (pre-tasks, bugs discovered, etc.)
   - Use awk range extraction:
     ```bash
     awk '/^#### Task 14:/,/^####[^#]|^###[^#]/ {print}' PLAN.md
     ```

5. **Create or update .flow/BACKLOG.md**:

   **If BACKLOG.md does NOT exist** (first time):

   ```markdown
   # Project Backlog

   This file contains tasks moved from PLAN.md to reduce active plan size while preserving all context.

   **Backlog Info**:
   - Tasks retain original numbers for easy reference
   - Full content preserved (brainstorming, iterations, everything)
   - Pull tasks back to active plan when ready to work on them

   **Last Updated**: [Current date]
   **Tasks in Backlog**: [Count]

   ---

   ## üìã Backlog Dashboard

   **Tasks Waiting**:
   - **Task [N]**: [Name]
   - **Task [N]**: [Name]

   ---

   ### Phase [N]: [Phase Name from PLAN.md]

   [Extracted task content here - preserve original task numbers]
   ```

   **If BACKLOG.md ALREADY exists**:
   - Read existing BACKLOG.md
   - Update "Last Updated" timestamp
   - Update "Tasks in Backlog" count
   - Add tasks to Backlog Dashboard list
   - Append task content to appropriate phase section
   - Maintain phase hierarchy (don't duplicate phase headers if they exist)

6. **Update PLAN.md**:

   **A. Remove task content**:
   - Delete full task sections for backlogged tasks
   - Leave gap in task numbering (don't renumber)
   - Add comment marking removal:
     ```markdown
     [Task 14 moved to backlog - see .flow/BACKLOG.md]
     [Task 15 moved to backlog - see .flow/BACKLOG.md]
     ```

   **B. Do NOT update Progress Dashboard**:
   - Backlog tasks are invisible to dashboard (no üì¶ marker)
   - Keep task numbers in dashboard but mark as moved:
     ```markdown
     - ‚è≥ Task 14: Potency system (moved to backlog)
     ```
   - Or simply remove from dashboard (user preference)

7. **Reset task status to ‚è≥ PENDING** (in BACKLOG.md):
   - All backlogged tasks reset to ‚è≥ PENDING
   - Fresh start when pulled back

8. **Verify and confirm**:
   - Count lines before/after PLAN.md (use `wc -l`)
   - Calculate reduction
   - Confirm to user:

     ```
     ‚úÖ Moved to backlog!

     **Backlogged**: [N] task(s) to .flow/BACKLOG.md
     **PLAN.md size**: Reduced from Y lines to Z lines (-W lines, -P%)
     **Tasks moved**: Task [list of numbers]

     Use `/flow-backlog-view` to see backlog contents.
     Use `/flow-backlog-pull <task-number>` to bring a task back when ready.
     ```

**Edge Cases**:
- **Task doesn't exist**: "Task [N] not found in PLAN.md"
- **Invalid range**: "Invalid range format. Use: /flow-backlog-add 14-22"
- **Empty range**: "No tasks found in range 14-22"
- **Already in backlog**: Check BACKLOG.md first, warn if task already there

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md (reduced), create/update .flow/BACKLOG.md (tasks preserved).

   - Extract task list from "Tasks Waiting" section

3. **Parse backlog metadata**:
   - Extract "Last Updated" timestamp
   - Extract "Tasks in Backlog" count
   - Parse task list (task numbers and names)

4. **Display backlog contents**:

   ```
   üì¶ Backlog Contents ([N] tasks):

   **Last Updated**: [Date]

   **Tasks Waiting**:
   - **Task 14**: Potency system
   - **Task 15**: Points & Luck systems
   - **Task 16**: Database persistence
   - **Task 17**: Damage variance
   - **Task 18**: Game integration
   - **Task 19**: Attribute Guarantee - HIGH
   - **Task 20**: Context Modifiers - CRITICAL
   - **Task 21**: Affix Synergy - MEDIUM
   - **Task 22**: Retry Handler - HIGH

   ---

   **Next Steps**:
   - Use `/flow-backlog-pull <task-number>` to move a task back to active plan
   - Example: `/flow-backlog-pull 14` brings Task 14 back as next task in active phase
   ```

5. **Optional: Show task details** (if user wants more info):
   - Can read full task content from BACKLOG.md on request
   - Default view is just dashboard (lightweight)

**Output**: Display backlog dashboard with task list and guidance.

```

description: Pull task from backlog back into active plan
---

You are executing the `/flow-backlog-pull` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Move a task from BACKLOG.md back to PLAN.md with sequential renumbering in active phase.

**üü¢ NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED - This command works entirely from PLAN.md and BACKLOG.md**

- Moves task content back to active plan
- Optional background reading (NOT required): DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 3407-3682 for backlog patterns

**Context**:

- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)
- **Backlog File**: .flow/BACKLOG.md (read and remove from)

**Signature**: `/flow-backlog-pull <task-number> [instruction-text]`

**Examples**:
- `/flow-backlog-pull 14` - Pull Task 14, insert at end of active phase with next available number
- `/flow-backlog-pull 14 insert after task 13` - Pull Task 14, position after Task 13 (but still renumber sequentially)
- `/flow-backlog-pull 14 add to phase 5` - Pull Task 14, add to Phase 5 instead of active phase

**Instructions**:

1. **Check if .flow/BACKLOG.md exists**:
   - If NOT found: "üì¶ Backlog is empty. Nothing to pull."
   - If found: Proceed

2. **Parse arguments**:
   - Required: Task number to pull (e.g., "14")
   - Optional: Instruction text for positioning (e.g., "insert after task 13")
   - Extract task number and instruction (if provided)

3. **Validate task exists in backlog**:
   - Search BACKLOG.md for `#### Task [N]:`
   - If NOT found: "Task [N] not found in backlog. Use `/flow-backlog-view` to see what's available."
   - If found: Proceed

4. **Extract full task content from BACKLOG.md**:
   - Use awk to extract complete task section:
     ```bash
     awk '/^#### Task 14:/,/^####[^#]|^###[^#]/ {print}' BACKLOG.md
     ```
   - Preserve ALL content (iterations, brainstorming, metadata, etc.)

5. **Determine insertion position in PLAN.md**:

   **A. Find active phase**:
   - Read Progress Dashboard to identify current phase
   - If instruction specifies different phase, use that instead

   **B. Calculate new task number**:
   - Find highest task number in target phase
   - New task number = highest + 1
   - Example: Phase 4 has Tasks 11, 12, 13 ‚Üí New task becomes Task 14

   **C. Determine insertion point** (where in file):
   - **Default** (no instruction): Insert after last task in target phase
   - **With instruction**: Parse instruction for positioning
     - "insert after task 13" ‚Üí Find Task 13, insert after it
     - "insert before task 12" ‚Üí Find Task 12, insert before it
     - "add to phase 5" ‚Üí Find Phase 5, insert at end
   - **Position ‚â† Number**: Task positioned after 13 but numbered as 14 (sequential)

6. **Renumber task header**:
   - Change `#### Task 14:` (old backlog number) to `#### Task [new-number]:`
   - Example: Backlog Task 14 becomes PLAN.md Task 14 (if next available)
   - Update task metadata with new number

7. **Insert task into PLAN.md**:
   - Insert full task content at determined position
   - Maintain proper markdown hierarchy
   - Preserve all nested content

8. **Remove task from BACKLOG.md**:
   - Delete complete task section from BACKLOG.md
   - Update Backlog Dashboard:
     - Remove task from "Tasks Waiting" list
     - Decrement "Tasks in Backlog" count
     - Update "Last Updated" timestamp
   - **No trace left** - as if task was never in backlog

9. **Update PLAN.md Progress Dashboard** (if it exists):
   - Add pulled task to dashboard
   - Update task count for target phase
   - Mark as ‚è≥ PENDING (fresh start)

10. **Verify and confirm**:
    - Confirm to user:

      ```
      ‚úÖ Pulled from backlog!

      **Task**: Task [old-number] from backlog ‚Üí Task [new-number] in PLAN.md
      **Phase**: Phase [N]: [Name]
      **Position**: [Description based on instruction or default]
      **Status**: ‚è≥ PENDING (ready to start)

      **Backlog**: [N-1] tasks remaining

      Use `/flow-task-start [new-number]` to begin this task when ready.
      ```

**Edge Cases**:
- **Backlog empty**: "Backlog is empty. Nothing to pull."
- **Task not in backlog**: "Task [N] not in backlog. Use `/flow-backlog-view` to see available tasks."
- **Invalid instruction**: Warn and use default positioning
- **No active phase**: Ask user which phase to add task to

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md (task added), update .flow/BACKLOG.md (task removed).

```

## Core Hierarchy

```
PHASE ‚Üí TASK ‚Üí ITERATION ‚Üí BRAINSTORM ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION ‚Üí COMPLETE
```

**Structure**:
- **PHASE**: High-level milestone (e.g., "Core Implementation", "Testing")
- **TASK**: Feature/component to build (e.g., "Database Schema", "API Endpoints")
- **ITERATION**: Incremental buildout (e.g., "V1: Basic validation", "V2: Advanced rules")
- **BRAINSTORM**: Design before code (subjects ‚Üí decisions ‚Üí action items)
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Execute action items from brainstorming

**Golden Rule**: Brainstorm ‚Üí Pre-Tasks ‚Üí Implementation (never skip brainstorming for complex work)

<!-- AI_SCAN:STATUS_MARKERS_QUICK:30-48 -->
## Status Markers

| Marker | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ | COMPLETE | Finished and verified (frozen, skip re-verification) |
| ‚è≥ | PENDING | Not started yet |
| üöß | IN PROGRESS | Currently working on this |

| üîÆ | DEFERRED | Moved to V2/V3/later (must document WHY + WHERE) |
| üéØ | ACTIVE | Current focus (optional, used in some contexts) |

**Rules**:
- Every Phase/Task/Iteration/Subject MUST have a status marker
- ‚úÖ COMPLETE items are verified & frozen (skip re-verification)
- ‚ùå CANCELLED and üîÆ DEFERRED must document reason

---

<!-- AI_SCAN:TASK_STRUCTURE_QUICK:50-108 -->
## Task Structure Rules

**The Golden Rule**: Tasks must be **EITHER** Standalone **OR** have Iterations - **NEVER BOTH**

### Pattern 1: Standalone Task (Direct Action Items)

```markdown
#### Task 5: Update Documentation ‚è≥

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Fix typos in guide
- [ ] Add examples
```

**When to Use**:
- Straightforward work (5-10 simple steps)
- No design decisions needed
- Can complete in one session
- Single focus

### Pattern 2: Task with Iterations (NO Direct Action Items)

```markdown
#### Task 7: Implement Payment Gateway üöß

**Purpose**: Integrate Stripe API for payment processing

---

##### Iteration 1: API Setup ‚è≥

**Goal**: Configure Stripe SDK and credentials

[Brainstorming ‚Üí Implementation]

---

##### Iteration 2: Payment Processing üöß

**Goal**: Implement charge creation and webhooks

[Currently implementing...]
```

**When to Use**:
- Large/complex task
- Needs design decisions (brainstorming required)
- Multiple stages (V1 ‚Üí V2 ‚Üí V3)
- Want incremental shipping

**NEVER**:
- ‚ùå Task with BOTH action items AND iterations (creates confusion about completion criteria)

**Exception**:
- ‚úÖ Pre-implementation tasks (from brainstorming) are allowed
- Pre-tasks completed BEFORE iterations start
- Structure: Task ‚Üí Iteration ‚Üí Brainstorming ‚Üí Pre-tasks ‚Üí Implementation

---

<!-- AI_SCAN:SUBJECT_RESOLUTION:112-129 -->
## Subject Resolution Types

When brainstorming, every resolved subject falls into ONE of these types:

| Type | Name | When | Action | Example |
|------|------|------|--------|---------|
| **A** | Pre-Implementation Task | Small code changes needed BEFORE iteration | Create pre-task (< 30 min work) | Fix interface, rename file, update enum |
| **B** | Immediate Documentation | Architectural decision, no code yet | Update Architecture section NOW | Design pattern choice, API contract |
| **C** | Auto-Resolved | Answered by another subject's decision | Mark as resolved by Subject N | Cascade decisions |
| **D** | Iteration Action Items | Substantial feature work that IS the iteration | Action items become iteration implementation | Build API endpoint, implement validator |

**Decision Flow**:
1. Does subject require code changes?
   - **NO** ‚Üí Type B (Documentation) or Type C (Auto-resolved)
   - **YES** ‚Üí Continue to #2
2. Is it small quick task (< 30 min)?
   - **YES** ‚Üí Type A (Pre-task)
   - **NO** ‚Üí Type D (Iteration work)

---

<!-- AI_SCAN:COMMON_PATTERNS:134-207 -->
## Common Patterns Quick Reference

### Brainstorming Pattern

```markdown
### **Brainstorming Session - [Topic]**

**Subjects to Discuss**:
1. ‚è≥ Subject 1
2. ‚è≥ Subject 2

**Resolved Subjects**:

---

### ‚úÖ Subject 1: [Name]

**Decision**: [Your decision]

**Resolution Type**: A / B / C / D

**Action Items** (if Type A or D):
- [ ] Action item 1
- [ ] Action item 2
```

**Workflow**:
1. `/flow-brainstorm-start` - Create session
2. `/flow-next-subject` - Resolve each subject (choose Type A/B/C/D)
3. **When all subjects resolved** ‚Üí Suggest `/flow-brainstorm-review` (NOT `/flow-brainstorm-complete`!)
4. `/flow-brainstorm-review` - AI suggests iterations/pre-tasks based on decisions
5. Complete any pre-tasks ‚Üí Then `/flow-brainstorm-complete`
6. `/flow-implement-start` - Begin coding

**CRITICAL**: After resolving last subject, ALWAYS suggest `/flow-brainstorm-review` first. This command creates iterations and identifies pre-implementation work. Only after review is complete should you suggest `/flow-brainstorm-complete`.

### Pre-Implementation Tasks Pattern

```markdown
### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**

#### ‚è≥ Task 1: [Name] (PENDING)

**Objective**: [What this accomplishes]

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2

**Files to Modify**:
- path/to/file.ts (what to change)
```

**When to Use**:
- Small preparatory work discovered during brainstorming
- Must be completed BEFORE `/flow-brainstorm-complete`
- Examples: Interface changes, file renames, bug fixes

### Implementation Pattern

```markdown
### **Implementation - Iteration [N]: [Name]**

**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS

**Action Items**: See resolved subjects above

**Implementation Notes**:
[Document discoveries during work]

**Files Modified**:
- `path/to/file.ts` - Description of changes

**Verification**: [How you verified it works]
```

## AI Reading Strategy (IMPORTANT!)

### ‚ùå **DON'T DO THIS**:
- Reading entire 4092-line file (~205k tokens)
- Reading framework when not needed
- Reading same sections repeatedly

### ‚úÖ **DO THIS INSTEAD**:

**Step 1**: Read Quick Reference (this section, lines 1-544, ~27k tokens)

**Step 2**: Identify what you need from Section Index

**Step 3**: Read ONLY that section using offset/limit:
```
Read(framework/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md, offset=597, limit=323)  # Task Structure Rules
```

**Step 4**: Skip framework entirely if not needed (e.g., `/flow-status` works from PLAN.md only)

**Token Savings**: 75-87% reduction (27-50k tokens vs 205k)

---

## Framework Reading Requirements by Command

**Category A - MUST READ Quick Reference** (~10 commands):
- `/flow-blueprint` - Needs patterns to generate plan structure
- `/flow-migrate` - Needs structure to convert existing docs
- `/flow-verify-plan` - Needs rules to validate plan consistency
- `/flow-brainstorm-start` - Needs subject resolution patterns
- `/flow-next-subject` - Needs resolution type guidance (A/B/C/D)
- `/flow-brainstorm-complete` - Needs completion criteria
- `/flow-task-add` - Needs task structure rules
- `/flow-iteration-add` - Needs iteration patterns

**Category B - NO FRAMEWORK NEEDED** (~15 commands):
- `/flow-status` - Dashboard-first approach, reads PLAN.md only ‚úÖ PERFECT EXAMPLE
- `/flow-summarize` - Reads PLAN.md structure only
- `/flow-next` - Uses Dashboard + iteration markers
- `/flow-implement-start` - Simple state transition
- `/flow-implement-complete` - Simple state transition
- `/flow-phase-start/complete` - Simple state transition
- `/flow-task-start/complete` - Simple state transition
- All simple PLAN.md state management commands

---

## Key Principles (Core Rules to Remember)

1. **Plan File as Single Source of Truth** - Everything documented in `.flow/PLAN.md`
2. **Brainstorm Before Code** - Design decisions upfront reduce refactoring
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Focus only on what's needed NOW, defer V2/V3
4. **State Preservation** - Checkboxes and status markers track all progress
5. **Minimal Refactoring** - Small iterations, complete before moving to next
6. **Scope Boundary Rule** - NEVER fix out-of-scope issues without user permission

---

## Testing Strategy Section (CRITICAL)

Every PLAN.md MUST have a Testing Strategy section that defines:
- **Methodology**: How you test (simulation, unit tests, TDD, manual QA)
- **Location**: Where test files live
- **Naming Convention**: Exact pattern (e.g., `{service}.scripts.ts` NOT `test.{service}.ts`)
- **When to create**: New file vs add to existing
- **Tooling**: What tools/frameworks you use

**Why**: AI must follow YOUR testing conventions exactly (prevents convention violations)

---

## Scope Boundary Rule (CRITICAL)

üö® **STOP ‚Üí NOTIFY ‚Üí DISCUSS ‚Üí AWAIT USER APPROVAL**

**When to Trigger**: You discover NEW issues during brainstorming or implementation that are NOT part of the current iteration's scope.

**The 4-Step Response Pattern**:

1. **STOP** immediately - Don't make assumptions or proceed
2. **NOTIFY** user - Present the discovered issue(s) clearly
3. **DISCUSS** - Provide structured options (A/B/C/D format)
4. **AWAIT USER APPROVAL** - Never proceed without explicit user decision

**Exception**: Syntax errors or blocking bugs in files you must modify (document what you fixed)

---

### Response Template (Use This Format)

When you discover scope boundary violations, use this structured response:

```markdown
üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY ALERT

I've discovered NEW issue(s) that are NOT part of the current iteration's scope:

**Issue 1: [Name]**
- **Problem**: [What's wrong or missing]
- **Impact**: [How it affects current/future work]
- **Location**: [File/component if applicable]

[Repeat for additional issues...]

---

## What Should We Do?

According to Scope Boundary Rule, I must:

1. ‚úÖ STOP - Done, I've stopped
2. ‚úÖ NOTIFY - Done, I've identified the issue(s)
3. ‚ùì DISCUSS - Your turn!

**Your Options**:

- **A**: Create pre-implementation task (< 30 min work, blocking current iteration)
- **B**: Add as new brainstorming subject (design needed before implementation)
- **C**: Handle immediately as part of this work (if you approve)
- **D**: Defer to separate iteration (handle after current work complete)

**What's your call?**
```

---

### Real-World Example (RED Project - Perfect Execution)

**Context**: During `/flow-next-subject` while designing skill generation system, AI discovered 3 NEW issues not part of current iteration.

**AI's Response** (Framework-Aware, CORRECT):

```markdown
üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY ALERT

I've discovered NEW issues that are NOT part of the current iteration's scope:

**Issue 1: I_Ability Interface Missing Fields**
- **Problem**: Interface missing `tier`, `affixes`, and `creator` fields
- **Impact**: Can't properly filter/validate abilities during generation
- **Location**: `src/interfaces/I_Ability.ts`

**Issue 2: Array vs Dictionary Performance**
- **Problem**: Using arrays for ability lookups (O(n) complexity)
- **Impact**: Performance degrades with large ability counts (1000+)
- **Location**: Ability collections throughout skill generation

**Issue 3: Definition vs Metadata Separation**
- **Problem**: Unclear boundary between ability definition and instance metadata
- **Impact**: Risk of data duplication and inconsistent state
- **Location**: Skill model design

---

## What Should We Do?

According to Scope Boundary Rule, I must:

1. ‚úÖ STOP - Done, I've stopped
2. ‚úÖ NOTIFY - Done, I've identified the issues
3. ‚ùì DISCUSS - Your turn!

**Your Options**:

- **A**: Create pre-implementation task to fix I_Ability interface (< 30 min work)
- **B**: Add as new brainstorming subject (#4) to design the solution
- **C**: Handle immediately as part of this subject (if you approve)
- **D**: Defer to separate iteration after this one

**What's your call?**
```

**User's Decision**: Option A (pre-task) for Issue 1, Option D (defer) for Issues 2 & 3

**Why This Was Perfect**:
- ‚úÖ AI stopped and didn't make assumptions
- ‚úÖ Clear, structured presentation of issues
- ‚úÖ Actionable options with implications
- ‚úÖ User stayed in control of priorities
- ‚úÖ Fast development with guardrails

---

### Good vs Bad Behavior

#### ‚ùå BAD: Scope Creep Without Permission

```markdown
I noticed the I_Ability interface is missing some fields, so I went ahead and added them.
Also refactored the ability storage to use a Map for better performance.
Let me know if you want me to change anything.
```

**Why This Is Bad**:
- Made decisions without user input
- Changed scope silently
- User loses control of priorities
- May solve wrong problem

#### ‚úÖ GOOD: Stop and Ask

```markdown
üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY ALERT

I've discovered the I_Ability interface is missing `tier`, `affixes`, and `creator` fields
needed for skill generation.

**Your Options**:
- **A**: Fix interface now as pre-task (< 30 min)
- **B**: Design in new brainstorming subject
- **C**: Handle immediately (if you approve)
- **D**: Defer to later iteration

**What's your call?**
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- Stopped immediately
- Clear problem statement
- Structured options
- User makes the decision

---

### When NOT to Trigger (Exceptions)

**1. Syntax Errors in Modified Files**:
```markdown
‚úÖ ALLOWED: Fixed TypeScript error in PaymentService.ts (missing return type)
‚ùå NOT ALLOWED: Refactored entire PaymentService to use async/await
```

**2. Import Statements for New Code**:
```markdown
‚úÖ ALLOWED: Added `import { Logger } from './logger'` for new logging code
‚ùå NOT ALLOWED: Reorganized all imports alphabetically across the file
```

**3. Trivial Formatting in Lines You're Editing**:
```markdown
‚úÖ ALLOWED: Fixed indentation on line you're modifying
‚ùå NOT ALLOWED: Reformatted entire file with Prettier
```

**Rule**: Document any scope exceptions in Implementation Notes.

---

### Why This Pattern Matters

**Vibe-Coding with Guardrails**:
- **Fast development** - AI finds issues proactively
- **User control** - User decides priorities
- **No scope creep** - Clear boundaries
- **Better decisions** - User has context AI doesn't

**Human Stays in Driver's Seat**:
- User knows project constraints (deadlines, complexity, tech debt)
- User has business context (what's actually important)
- User understands team dynamics (who's working on what)
- AI provides analysis, user provides judgment

---

### Implementation in Commands

All brainstorming and implementation commands include Scope Boundary Rule reminders:

- `/flow-brainstorm-start`, `/flow-brainstorm-subject`, `/flow-next-subject`
- `/flow-implement-start`, `/flow-implement-complete`
- Any command that involves code changes or design decisions

See command definitions in SLASH_COMMANDS.md for specific implementations.

<!-- AI_SCAN:PHILOSOPHY_PRINCIPLES:361-456 -->
# Domain-Driven Design with Agile Iterative Philosophy

**A spec-driven iterative development framework for building complex features with minimal refactoring.**

---

## Philosophy

This framework combines **Domain-Driven Design** principles with an **Agile iterative approach** to software development. The core analogy is building the human body:

1. **Skeleton first** - Create the basic structure and foundational components
2. **Add veins** - Implement core data flow and connections
3. **Add flesh** - Layer on complexity incrementally
4. **Add fibers** - Refine and optimize

By splitting development into minuscule, well-planned iterations, you build a strong foundation and expand complexity over time while keeping refactoring to a minimum.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Plan File as Single Source of Truth

- Every feature/project/issue has a dedicated `.flow/PLAN.md` file
- Flow manages the plan from the `.flow/` directory in your project root
- The plan file survives across sessions and maintains complete context
- All decisions, brainstorming results, and implementation progress are documented
- AI agents and humans can resume work from any point by reading the plan

**File Structure**:
```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .flow/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PLAN.md              # Flow-managed plan (single source of truth)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (optional - project-specific framework guide)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Getting Started**:
- **New project**: Use `/flow-blueprint [description]` to create fresh `.flow/PLAN.md`
- **Existing project**: Use `/flow-migrate [file]` to convert existing documentation to Flow format
- Both commands create `.flow/PLAN.md` and take full control of plan management

### 2. Iterative Development Loop

```

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

- Each iteration focuses ONLY on what's needed NOW
- Future complexity is deferred to V2/V3/etc.
- Prevents scope creep and over-engineering

### 4. State Preservation

- Every step updates the plan file with checkboxes (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß)
- Timestamps and status markers track progress
- Complete audit trail of all decisions

### 5. Minimal Refactoring

- Brainstorm BEFORE implementing to make correct decisions upfront
- Split complex features into small, testable iterations
- Each iteration is complete and stable before moving to next

### 6. Scope Boundary Rule (CRITICAL)

**üö® NEVER fix out-of-scope issues without explicit user permission.**

When working within **any Flow scope** (Phase/Task/Iteration/Brainstorming/Pre-Implementation Task), if you discover a NEW issue that is NOT part of the current work:

1. **STOP** current work immediately
2. **NOTIFY** user of the new issue discovered
3. **DISCUSS** with user what to do:
   - Add as new brainstorming subject?
   - Create new pre-implementation task?
   - Defer to next iteration?
   - Handle immediately (only if user explicitly approves)?
4. **ONLY** proceed with user's explicit approval

**Examples of scope violations**:
- Working on Pre-Implementation Task 2 (fix validation bug), discover Test 3 has unrelated placeholder parsing issue ‚Üí **STOP, ask user**
- Implementing Iteration 5 (add error handling), notice Iteration 2 code has typo ‚Üí **STOP, ask user**
- Resolving brainstorm Subject 3 (API design), realize database schema needs refactoring ‚Üí **STOP, ask user**

**Why this matters**:
- Prevents scope creep and uncontrolled changes
- Maintains Flow's intentional progression
- Preserves user's ability to prioritize work
- Keeps iterations focused and reviewable
- Avoids "fixing" things that may be intentional or have hidden dependencies

**The only exception**: Fixing issues that are **directly blocking** the current task (e.g., syntax error in file you must modify). Even then, document what you fixed and why.

### 7. UX Principles for Flow Commands

**Purpose**: These principles guide all command behavior to ensure consistent, token-efficient, user-friendly interactions.

**The 6 UX Principles**:

**1. Token Efficiency First**
- Minimize rejection messages (< 80 tokens)
- Avoid verbose templates/examples unless first-time user
- Use compact previews, not full explanations
- Every token counts - reject fast, create efficiently
- Example: Dry-run preview (200-500 tokens) vs full generation (5000+ tokens) = 90%+ savings

**2. Never Block for Cosmetic Reasons**
- Phase/task commands accept minimal input
- Use [TBD] placeholders, don't reject
- User controls quality (can fill or leave incomplete)
- Cosmetic sections shouldn't block workflow
- Example: `/flow-phase-add "Testing"` ‚Üí Creates phase with [TBD] fields, doesn't reject

**3. Progressive Disclosure**
- Show complexity only when needed
- First rejection: educational (with examples)
- Subsequent rejections: minimal (just example)
- Advanced features: available but not pushed
- Don't overwhelm with options upfront
- Example: First error shows template, next errors show just one-line example

**4. Explicit > Implicit**
- Honor user's explicit structure (create it)
- Don't auto-generate from vague input (suggest instead)
- Confirmations for large operations (blueprint), not small ones (phase/task)
- User's explicit intent always wins
- Example: `/flow-blueprint` with "Phase 1:", "Task 2:" ‚Üí CREATE; without ‚Üí SUGGEST

**5. Guide, Don't Dictate**
- Suggest next commands after creation
- Show what was created (summary)
- Don't force workflow (user chooses path)
- Provide options, let user decide
- Example: After `/flow-brainstorm-complete` ‚Üí Suggest `/flow-implement-start` but don't auto-run it

**6. Honest Communication**
- Use [TBD] when info is missing (don't fake it)
- Show what AI inferred vs what user provided
- Clear distinction between suggestion and creation
- Transparency builds trust
- Example: "Strategy: [Inferred from description]" vs "Strategy: [TBD - fill this in]"

**Application to Commands**:

**For `/flow-blueprint`**:
- Token efficiency: Dry-run preview is compact (< 500 tokens)
- Explicit > Implicit: Mode B creates explicit structure, Mode A suggests
- Guide, don't dictate: Show next commands after creation
- Honest communication: Show what was extracted vs inferred

**For `/flow-phase-add` & `/flow-task-add`**:
- Never block: Accept minimal input, use [TBD] placeholders
- Token efficiency: No verbose rejections, just accept and create
- Honest communication: Mark [TBD] clearly, extract rich context when provided
- Guide, don't dictate: Create what's asked, suggest refinement after

**For All Commands**:
- Progressive disclosure: First error shows examples, subsequent errors are minimal
- Token efficiency: All responses < 200 tokens unless generating structure
- Explicit > Implicit: No assumptions, honor user's explicit input

### Testing Strategy Section (REQUIRED)

**Purpose**: Define HOW you verify implementations so AI follows YOUR testing conventions exactly.

**Must Include**:
1. **Methodology**: How you test (simulation, unit tests, TDD, integration, manual QA, etc.)
2. **Location**: Where test files live (directory path)
3. **Naming Convention**: Test file naming pattern (CRITICAL - AI must follow exactly)
4. **When to create**: When to create NEW test files vs. add to existing
5. **When to add**: When to add test cases to existing files
6. **Tooling**: What tools/frameworks you use (Jest, Vitest, custom scripts, etc.)

**Common Approaches**:

- **Simulation-based (per-service pattern)**: Each service has its own orchestration file
  - Example: `scripts/{service}.scripts.ts` (blue.scripts.ts, green.scripts.ts, red.scripts.ts)
  - AI creates `scripts/gold.scripts.ts` if working on new "gold" service
  - AI adds to `scripts/blue.scripts.ts` if file already exists
  - **Convention matters**: `{service}.scripts.ts` NOT `test.{service}.*.ts`

- **Simulation-based (single file)**: All tests in one orchestration file
  - Example: `scripts/run.scripts.ts` handles all services
  - AI adds test cases to existing file, never creates new test files

- **Unit tests after implementation**: Write tests after code works
  - Example: `__tests__/{feature}.test.ts` created after iteration complete
  - AI creates `__tests__/payment-gateway.test.ts` for new features
  - AI adds test cases to existing file if feature already tested

- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Write tests before implementation
  - Example: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor cycle
  - AI creates `tests/{feature}.spec.ts` first, then implements to make it pass

- **Integration/E2E focused**: Minimal unit tests, focus on workflows
  - Example: `e2e/{workflow}.spec.ts` for critical user journeys
  - AI creates new E2E test for each major workflow

- **Manual QA only**: No automated tests
  - AI never creates test files, provides manual verification checklist instead

**Why This Matters**:
- **Prevents convention violations**: AI won't create `test.blue.validation.ts` when your pattern is `blue.scripts.ts`
- **Respects file structure**: AI knows WHERE to create test files (scripts/ vs __tests__ vs e2e/)
- **Follows naming patterns**: AI matches YOUR naming convention exactly
- **Knows when to create vs. add**: AI creates new files for new features, adds to existing for enhancements
- **Ensures verification happens at the right time**: During iteration, after, or before (TDD)

**Example 1 - Per-Service Simulation** (like RED project):
```markdown
## Testing Strategy

**Methodology**: Simulation-based orchestration per service

**Approach**:
- Each service has its own orchestration file: `scripts/{service}.scripts.ts`
- **Naming Convention**: `{service}.scripts.ts` (e.g., `blue.scripts.ts`, `green.scripts.ts`, `red.scripts.ts`)
- **Location**: `scripts/` directory
- **When to create**: If `scripts/{service}.scripts.ts` doesn't exist for new service, create it
- **When to add**: If file exists, add new test cases to existing orchestration
- Tests simulate real-world usage patterns (spell generation, validation, etc.)

**Test Execution**:
```bash
bun run scripts/run.scripts.ts           # Run all services
bun run scripts/{service}.scripts.ts      # Run specific service
```

**File Structure**:
```
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run.scripts.ts        # Main orchestration (runs all services)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blue.scripts.ts       # Blue service tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ green.scripts.ts      # Green service tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ red.scripts.ts        # Red service tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gold.scripts.ts       # Gold service tests (create if new service)
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- ‚ùå Do NOT create `test.{service}.*.ts` files (wrong naming pattern)
- ‚ùå Do NOT create files outside `scripts/` directory (wrong location)
- ‚úÖ DO follow `{service}.scripts.ts` pattern exactly
- ‚úÖ DO create new `{service}.scripts.ts` for new services
```

**Example 2 - Unit Tests After Implementation**:
```markdown
## Testing Strategy

**Methodology**: Unit tests after implementation using Jest

**Approach**:
- Unit tests created AFTER implementation is verified manually
- **Naming Convention**: `{feature}.test.ts` (e.g., `payment-gateway.test.ts`)
- **Location**: `__tests__/` directory
- **When to create**: After iteration implementation complete and working
- **When to add**: If feature already has test file, add new test cases

**Test Execution**: `npm test`

**IMPORTANT**:
- ‚úÖ Create `__tests__/new-feature.test.ts` for new features
- ‚úÖ Add test cases to `__tests__/existing-feature.test.ts` for enhancements
- ‚ùå Do NOT create tests before implementation (we're not doing TDD)
```

<!-- AI_SCAN:TASK_STRUCTURE:597-920 -->
## Task Structure Rules

### The Golden Rule: Standalone OR Iterations, Never Both

**Every task must follow ONE of these two patterns:**

#### Pattern 1: Standalone Task (Direct Action Items)

**Structure**:
```markdown
#### Task N: [Task Name] ‚è≥

**Status**: PENDING
**Purpose**: [What this task accomplishes]

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Action item 1
- [ ] Action item 2
- [ ] Action item 3
```

**When to Use**:
- ‚úÖ Task is straightforward with clear steps
- ‚úÖ No design decisions needed
- ‚úÖ Can complete in one work session
- ‚úÖ Small scope (5-10 simple steps)
- ‚úÖ Single focus (e.g., "Migrate constants", "Update README")

**Examples**:
- "Migrate constants from Blue to shared file" (5 simple steps)
- "Update documentation with new API endpoints" (straightforward)
- "Rename service files to match naming convention" (clear steps)
- "Install dependencies and configure linter" (setup task)

---

#### Pattern 2: Task with Iterations (NO Direct Action Items)

**Structure**:
```markdown
#### Task N: [Task Name] ‚è≥

**Status**: PENDING
**Purpose**: [What this task accomplishes]

**Scope**: [High-level description]

---

##### Iteration 1: [Iteration Name] ‚è≥

**Status**: PENDING
**Goal**: [What this iteration builds]

[Brainstorming ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Complete]

---

##### Iteration 2: [Iteration Name] ‚è≥

**Status**: PENDING
**Goal**: [What this iteration builds]

[Brainstorming ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Complete]
```

**When to Use**:
- ‚úÖ Task is large or complex
- ‚úÖ Needs design decisions (brainstorming required)
- ‚úÖ Multiple stages of implementation (V1 ‚Üí V2 ‚Üí V3)
- ‚úÖ Natural splitting points exist
- ‚úÖ Want to ship incremental progress

**Examples**:
- "Implement Green Service" ‚Üí Iteration 1: Tier Generation, Iteration 2: Validation, Iteration 3: Testing
- "Build Payment Gateway Integration" ‚Üí Iteration 1: API Setup, Iteration 2: Payment Processing, Iteration 3: Webhooks
- "Add Error Handling System" ‚Üí Iteration 1: Basic Errors, Iteration 2: Retry Logic, Iteration 3: Logging

---

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern: Task with BOTH Action Items AND Iterations

**NEVER DO THIS**:

```markdown
#### Task 5: Implement Validation System ‚è≥

**Status**: PENDING

**Action Items**:  ‚Üê ‚ùå WRONG: Task has both action items...
- [ ] Design validation rules
- [ ] Create validator interface

---

##### Iteration 1: Basic Validation ‚è≥  ‚Üê ‚ùå ...AND iterations!

**Status**: PENDING
**Goal**: Implement basic input validation
```

**Why This is Wrong**:
- ‚ùì Unclear what "task complete" means (action items done? iterations done? both?)
- ‚ùì Are action items prerequisites for iterations or parallel work?
- ‚ùì Should iterations start immediately or after action items?
- üö´ Creates confusion and ambiguity

**How to Fix**:

**Option A** - Make it standalone (if simple):
```markdown
#### Task 5: Implement Basic Validation ‚è≥

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Design validation rules
- [ ] Create validator interface
- [ ] Implement basic input validation
- [ ] Add unit tests
```

**Option B** - Make it have iterations (if complex):
```markdown
#### Task 5: Implement Validation System ‚è≥

**Purpose**: Build comprehensive validation system with retry logic

---

##### Iteration 1: Design & Interface ‚è≥

**Goal**: Design validation rules and create validator interface

[Brainstorming ‚Üí Implementation]

---

##### Iteration 2: Basic Validation ‚è≥

**Goal**: Implement basic input validation

[Implementation]
```

---

### Exception: Pre-Implementation Tasks

**Tasks with iterations CAN have pre-implementation tasks** (from brainstorming):

```markdown
#### Task 7: Implement Error Handling üöß

**Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

##### Iteration 1: Basic Error Types üöß

**Status**: IN PROGRESS

### **Brainstorming Session - Error Handling Design**

[Subjects resolved...]

### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**  ‚Üê ‚úÖ ALLOWED: Pre-tasks from brainstorming

#### ‚úÖ Task 1: Update I_Error interface (COMPLETE)
#### ‚úÖ Task 2: Rename error.ts to errorHandler.ts (COMPLETE)

### **Implementation - Iteration 1**

**Action Items**: See resolved subjects above (Type 2 items from brainstorming)
```

**Why Pre-Tasks Are Allowed**:
- Pre-tasks are NOT task-level action items
- Pre-tasks come FROM brainstorming (Type A resolutions)
- Pre-tasks are completed BEFORE iteration implementation starts
- Structure: Task ‚Üí Iteration ‚Üí Brainstorming ‚Üí Pre-tasks ‚Üí Implementation

**Pre-Task Scope**:
- ‚úÖ Small preparatory work (< 30 min)
- ‚úÖ Setup before iteration (interface changes, file renames, bug fixes)
- ‚úÖ Blocking issues that must be fixed first

---

### Decision Guide: Should This Be Standalone or Have Iterations?

Ask yourself these questions:

| Question | Standalone Task | Task with Iterations |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Is this task complex?** | No, straightforward | Yes, needs design |
| **Design decisions needed?** | No | Yes (brainstorming required) |
| **Can complete in one session?** | Yes | No, needs splitting |
| **Natural splitting points?** | No | Yes (V1 ‚Üí V2, stages) |
| **Want incremental shipping?** | No, ship all at once | Yes, ship by iteration |
| **How many steps?** | 5-10 simple steps | Many complex steps |

**Rule of Thumb**:
- **If you need brainstorming** ‚Üí Use iterations
- **If steps are obvious** ‚Üí Use standalone
- **If task is one concept** ‚Üí Use standalone
- **If task has multiple stages** ‚Üí Use iterations

---

### Examples of Well-Structured Tasks

#### Good Example 1: Standalone Task

```markdown
#### Task 3: Migrate Constants to Shared File ‚è≥

**Status**: PENDING
**Purpose**: Move all service constants to shared constants file for reusability

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create src/shared/constants.ts file
- [ ] Move Blue service constants
- [ ] Move Green service constants
- [ ] Move Red service constants
- [ ] Update imports in all services
- [ ] Verify no build errors
```

**Why This Works**: Clear, simple, straightforward steps. No design decisions. Can complete in one session.

---

#### Good Example 2: Task with Iterations

```markdown
#### Task 5: Implement Green Service üöß

**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Purpose**: Build Green service for tier generation with validation and selection

**Scope**: Create complete Green service following RED pattern with tier generation, filtering, selection, and validation logic.

---

##### Iteration 1: Tier Generation ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-09-30
**Goal**: Generate spell tiers based on tier type and constraints

[Brainstorming ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Complete]

---

##### Iteration 2: Spell Filtering ‚è≥

**Status**: PENDING
**Goal**: Filter spells by tier and element type

---

##### Iteration 3: Spell Selection üöß

**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Select spells using weight-based constraint solver

[Currently implementing...]
```

**Why This Works**: Large complex task split into focused iterations. Each iteration has clear goal. Natural progression (generate ‚Üí filter ‚Üí select).

---

#### Bad Example 1: Task with Both

```markdown
‚ùå BAD:

#### Task 8: Implement Validation System ‚è≥

**Action Items**:  ‚Üê Mixing task-level action items...
- [ ] Design validation rules
- [ ] Create interfaces

##### Iteration 1: Basic Validation ‚è≥  ‚Üê ...with iterations

**Goal**: Implement basic input validation
```

**Fix**: Choose standalone OR iterations, not both.

---

#### Bad Example 2: Iteration Disguised as Standalone

```markdown
‚ùå BAD:

#### Task 10: Implement Complete Payment Gateway ‚è≥

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Set up Stripe SDK
- [ ] Design API endpoints  ‚Üê This needs brainstorming!
- [ ] Implement payment processing  ‚Üê This is large!
- [ ] Add webhook handlers  ‚Üê Multiple stages needed!
- [ ] Create retry logic  ‚Üê Complex algorithm!
- [ ] Add error handling  ‚Üê Another full feature!
- [ ] Write integration tests
```

**Fix**: This should be a task with iterations, each tackling one stage.

---

### Summary: Task Structure Checklist

Before creating a task, ask:

- [ ] Does this task need design decisions? **YES** ‚Üí Use iterations
- [ ] Can I complete this in one session? **NO** ‚Üí Use iterations
- [ ] Does this have natural splitting points? **YES** ‚Üí Use iterations
- [ ] Are all steps obvious and simple? **YES** ‚Üí Use standalone
- [ ] Is this one focused concept? **YES** ‚Üí Use standalone

**Remember**: Standalone OR iterations, never both. Pre-implementation tasks (from brainstorming) are the only exception.

<!-- AI_SCAN:DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW:928-967 -->
## Development Workflow

### Step 1: Decide What to Work On

Choose the scope:

- **Phase**: Major milestone (e.g., "Core Implementation")
- **Task**: Specific feature/component (e.g., "Implement Green Service")
- **Iteration**: Incremental piece (e.g., "Iteration 1: Tier Generation")

### Step 2: Brainstorm

Break down the iteration into **subjects to discuss**:

- Architecture decisions
- Implementation approach
- Edge cases and constraints
- Data structures
- Algorithm choices

For each subject:

1. Discuss options (Option A, B, C...)
2. Document rationale
3. Make a decision
4. Create **action items** (checkboxes)

### Step 3: Implementation

Work through action items sequentially:

- Check off each item as completed
- Update plan file with results
- Add notes/discoveries during implementation

### Step 4: Mark Complete

- All action items checked ‚Üí Iteration complete
- All iterations complete ‚Üí Task complete
- All tasks complete ‚Üí Phase complete

### Step 5: Repeat

Move to next iteration, applying lessons learned.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### 1. Initialize Project

**Command**: `/flow-blueprint [description]` OR `/flow-migrate [file-path]`

**Purpose**: Create `.flow/PLAN.md` with initial structure

**What Happens**:
- **flow-blueprint**: AI generates phases/tasks/iterations based on feature description
- **flow-migrate**: Converts existing documentation to Flow format

**Output**: `.flow/PLAN.md` created with project structure

**Next Step**: Review generated plan, add/modify phases and tasks if needed

---

#### 1a. Blueprint Modes (Understanding /flow-blueprint Behavior)

**Purpose**: `/flow-blueprint` has two modes based on input - understanding these modes helps you provide the right level of detail.

**Mode A: SUGGEST Structure** (AI Designs the Plan)

**Trigger**: You provide a description WITHOUT explicit structure markers

**Examples**:
```bash
/flow-blueprint "Payment gateway integration"
/flow-blueprint "User authentication system"
/flow-blueprint "Build a real-time chat application"
```

**What Happens**:
1. AI reads your description
2. AI may ask clarifying questions (testing strategy, reference implementations, etc.)
3. AI generates suggested phases/tasks/iterations based on best practices
4. You review and modify as needed

**Best For**:
- New projects where you want AI to suggest structure
- Features where you're exploring the best approach
- When you want framework guidance on how to break down work

**Example Output**:
```markdown
‚ú® Created .flow/PLAN.md for "Payment Gateway Integration"

**Generated Structure**:
- Phase 1: Foundation (API integration, basic flow)
- Phase 2: Core Implementation (webhooks, retry logic)
- Phase 3: Testing & Validation

Use `/flow-status` to see current state
Use `/flow-brainstorm-start [topic]` to begin first iteration
```

---

**Mode B: CREATE Explicit Structure** (You Design the Plan)

**Trigger**: You provide explicit structure markers in your description

**Structure Markers**:
- "Phase 1:", "Phase 2:", etc.
- "Task 1:", "Task 2:", etc.
- "Iteration 1:", "Iteration 2:", etc.
- Bullet lists suggesting phases/tasks/iterations

**Examples**:
```bash
/flow-blueprint "Payment Gateway

Phase 1: Foundation
- Task 1: Setup Stripe SDK
- Task 2: Create payment models

Phase 2: Implementation
- Task 1: Payment processing
  - Iteration 1: Basic flow
  - Iteration 2: Error handling
- Task 2: Webhook integration"
```

**What Happens**:
1. AI detects explicit structure in your input
2. AI shows dry-run preview of what will be created
3. You confirm (yes/no)
4. AI creates your exact structure with [TBD] for missing metadata

**Best For**:
- You already know the phases/tasks breakdown
- Migrating from another planning system
- You have specific work breakdown preferences
- Quick project setup without AI suggestions

**Example Dry-Run Preview**:
```markdown
üìã Detected explicit structure. I will create:

**Phase 1: Foundation** ‚è≥
- Task 1: Setup Stripe SDK ‚è≥
- Task 2: Create payment models ‚è≥

**Phase 2: Implementation** ‚è≥
- Task 1: Payment processing ‚è≥
  - Iteration 1: Basic flow ‚è≥
  - Iteration 2: Error handling ‚è≥
- Task 2: Webhook integration ‚è≥

Missing metadata will use [TBD] placeholders (refine later).

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

**If you say "yes"**:
```markdown
‚ú® Created .flow/PLAN.md from your explicit structure

**Structure**: 2 phases, 3 tasks, 2 iterations (as you specified)

**[TBD] placeholders used for**:
- Phase strategies
- Task purposes
- Testing strategy

üí° Refine [TBD] sections during brainstorming or use `/flow-plan-update`

Use `/flow-status` to see current state
```

---

**Choosing the Right Mode**:

| Use Mode A (SUGGEST) If... | Use Mode B (CREATE) If... |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| You want AI to suggest best practices | You already have a work breakdown |
| You're exploring different approaches | You know exactly what phases/tasks you need |
| You want framework guidance | You're migrating from another system |
| You're new to the project domain | You have specific organizational preferences |
| You want comprehensive Testing Strategy generated | You'll define Testing Strategy later |

**Pro Tip**: Start with Mode A for new projects (get AI suggestions), then use `/flow-phase-add` and `/flow-task-add` to refine the structure. This combines AI guidance with your domain expertise.

---

#### 2. Add Structure (Optional)

**Commands**: `/flow-phase-add [description]`, `/flow-task-add [description]`

**Purpose**: Add additional phases or tasks not generated by blueprint

**When to Use**:
- Blueprint missed important milestones (add phase)
- Need to break down work further (add task)
- Discovered new requirements during planning

**Output**: Updated PLAN.md with new structure

**Next Step**: Start working on first phase

---

#### 3. Start Phase

**Command**: `/flow-phase-start [phase-number]`

**Purpose**: Mark phase as üöß IN PROGRESS

**When to Use**: Ready to begin work on the phase

**What Happens**:
- Phase status changes from ‚è≥ PENDING ‚Üí üöß IN PROGRESS
- Progress Dashboard updated to point to this phase

**Output**: Phase marked in progress

**Next Step**: Start first task in the phase

#### 4. Start Task

**Command**: `/flow-task-start [task-number]`

**Purpose**: Mark task as üöß IN PROGRESS

**When to Use**: Ready to begin work on the task

**Decision Point**: Does this task need design decisions?
- **YES (complex task)** ‚Üí Go to Step 5 (Brainstorming)
- **NO (straightforward task)** ‚Üí Go to Step 6 (Optional Iterations) or directly to Step 8 (Work on Action Items)

**Output**: Task marked in progress

**Next Step**: Brainstorm (if complex) or work directly (if simple)

---

#### 5. Brainstorm (Optional - for Complex Tasks)

**Command**: `/flow-brainstorm-start [topics]`

**Purpose**: Design before coding - make architectural decisions upfront

**When to Use**:
- Task requires architectural decisions
- Multiple implementation approaches possible
- Edge cases need discussion
- Data structure choices needed
- Algorithm selection required

**When to Skip**:
- Task is straightforward (e.g., "Update README")
- No design decisions needed
- Implementation approach is obvious

**Workflow**:

```
/flow-brainstorm-start "API design, data structure, error handling"
  ‚Üì
AI creates subjects from your topics
  ‚Üì
/flow-next-subject (discuss first subject)
  ‚Üì
Resolve subject ‚Üí Document decision ‚Üí Create action items
  ‚Üì
Repeat for all subjects
  ‚Üì
/flow-brainstorm-review
  ‚Üì
AI suggests follow-up work:
  - Type A: Pre-implementation tasks (small quick fixes)
  - Type B: Immediate documentation updates
  - Type C: Auto-resolved subjects
  - Type D: Iteration action items (feature work)
  ‚Üì
Complete any pre-implementation tasks
  ‚Üì
/flow-brainstorm-complete
```

**Subject Resolution Types**:

| Type | Name | When | Action | Example |
|------|------|------|--------|---------|
| **A** | Pre-Implementation Task | Small code changes needed BEFORE iteration | Create pre-task (< 30 min work) | Fix interface, rename file, migrate enum |
| **B** | Immediate Documentation | Architectural decision, no code yet | Update Architecture section NOW | Design pattern choice, API contract |
| **C** | Auto-Resolved | Answered by another subject's decision | Mark as resolved by Subject N | Cascade decisions |
| **D** | Iteration Action Items | Substantial feature work that IS the iteration | Action items become iteration implementation | Build API endpoint, implement validator |

**Output**: Brainstorming complete, iteration marked üé® READY

**Next Step**: Optional iterations (Step 6) or direct implementation (Step 8)

---

#### 5a. Action Items Categorization (Critical for Implementation Planning)

**Purpose**: After brainstorming, you have a list of action items from resolved subjects. Understanding which TYPE each action item is determines WHEN and WHERE the work happens.

**The 3 Types of Action Items**:

##### Type 1: Pre-Implementation Tasks (Blockers)

**What**: Work that MUST be done BEFORE starting the main iteration implementation.

**Characteristics**:
- Blocks the main work (can't proceed without it)
- Usually refactoring, infrastructure setup, or bug fixes
- Typically quick wins (< 30 minutes each)
- Discovered during design discussions

**Examples**:
- Refactor legacy auth module to use new interface
- Fix broken test suite that will interfere with new work
- Setup database migration infrastructure
- Extract duplicated code into shared utility
- Rename confusing variable that will be used in iteration

**Where They Go**: Separate "Pre-Implementation Tasks" section in the iteration

**When Completed**: BEFORE running `/flow-implement-start`

**PLAN.md Structure**:
```markdown
##### Iteration 1: User Authentication üöß

**Brainstorming**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Pre-Implementation Tasks**:

###### ‚è≥ Task 1: Refactor Legacy Auth Module
- [ ] Extract auth logic to AuthService interface
- [ ] Update controllers to use interface

###### ‚è≥ Task 2: Fix Session Store Tests
- [ ] Update mocked session store
- [ ] Add missing test cases

**Implementation**: ‚è≥ PENDING (waiting for pre-tasks)
```

##### Type 2: Implementation Work (The Iteration Itself)

**What**: The actual work of the current iteration - this IS the main work.

**Characteristics**:
- The core feature/functionality being built
- What the iteration is named after
- The bulk of the work
- Can't be deferred to later

**Examples**:
- Implement JWT generation endpoint
- Add refresh token rotation logic
- Create password hashing utility
- Build login form validation
- Add authentication middleware

**Where They Go**: Action items IN the iteration's Implementation section

**When Completed**: DURING implementation (after running `/flow-implement-start`)

**PLAN.md Structure**:
```markdown
##### Iteration 1: User Authentication üöß

**Implementation**: üöß IN PROGRESS

**Action Items**: See resolved subjects above (Type 2 items)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implemented JWT generation using jose library
- Added refresh token rotation with 7-day expiry
- [Document progress here as you work]

**Files Modified**:
- `src/auth/jwt.ts` - JWT generation and validation
- `src/auth/refresh.ts` - Token rotation logic
```

##### Type 3: New Iterations (Future Work)

**What**: Follow-up work for future iterations - important but not blocking current work.

**Characteristics**:
- Discovered during brainstorming but not part of current iteration
- V2/V3 features, optimizations, edge cases
- Can be done later without blocking current work
- Often improvements or enhancements

**Examples**:
- Add OAuth provider support (V2 feature)
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts (V3 optimization)
- Add biometric authentication (future enhancement)
- Support multi-factor authentication (V2 feature)
- Add session analytics dashboard (V3 feature)

**Where They Go**: New iterations created with `/flow-iteration-add`

**When Completed**: In future iterations (separate from current work)

**PLAN.md Structure**:
```markdown
##### Iteration 1: User Authentication ‚úÖ
[Current iteration work]

##### Iteration 2: OAuth Integration ‚è≥
**Goal**: Add OAuth provider support (Google, GitHub)
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Implement OAuth callback handler
- [ ] Add provider configuration
- [ ] Create OAuth middleware
```

---

#### Decision Tree for Categorization

When reviewing brainstorming action items, ask these questions in order:

**Question 1**: Does this BLOCK the main work?
- YES ‚Üí **Type 1: Pre-Implementation Task**
  - Example: "Can't implement JWT auth until we refactor the old auth module"
- NO ‚Üí Continue to Question 2

**Question 2**: Is this THE main work of this iteration?
- YES ‚Üí **Type 2: Implementation Work**
  - Example: "Implementing JWT generation IS the iteration goal"
- NO ‚Üí Continue to Question 3

**Question 3**: Is this future work that can wait?
- YES ‚Üí **Type 3: New Iteration**
  - Example: "OAuth is nice to have but not required for basic auth"
- NO ‚Üí You may have misunderstood - review questions again

**If Still Uncertain**: ASK THE USER!
- Present the action item
- Explain your reasoning for each type
- Let the user decide

---

#### Examples of Categorization

**Scenario**: Brainstorming for "Payment Gateway Integration" iteration

**Resolved Subjects Generated These Action Items**:
1. Extract payment config to environment variables
2. Implement Stripe payment intent creation
3. Add webhook signature verification
4. Fix broken webhook endpoint from previous work
5. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
6. Support PayPal integration
7. Add payment analytics dashboard
8. Create payment refund endpoint

**Categorization**:

**Type 1 - Pre-Implementation Tasks** (do BEFORE starting):
- Item 1: Extract payment config to environment variables (blocks main work, uses hardcoded values)
- Item 4: Fix broken webhook endpoint from previous work (blocks testing)

**Type 2 - Implementation Work** (do DURING iteration):
- Item 2: Implement Stripe payment intent creation (core iteration work)
- Item 3: Add webhook signature verification (core iteration work)
- Item 5: Add retry logic with exponential backoff (core iteration work)
- Item 8: Create payment refund endpoint (core iteration work)

**Type 3 - New Iterations** (do LATER):
- Item 6: Support PayPal integration (V2 feature, separate provider)
- Item 7: Add payment analytics dashboard (V3 feature, not required for MVP)

**Result**:
- 2 pre-implementation tasks ‚Üí Complete before `/flow-implement-start`
- 4 implementation items ‚Üí Work on after `/flow-implement-start`
- 2 new iterations ‚Üí Create with `/flow-iteration-add` for future work

---

**Key Insight**: This categorization happens DURING `/flow-brainstorm-review`. The AI should present suggested categorization and ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

---

#### 6. Add Iterations (Optional - for Split Work)

**Command**: `/flow-iteration-add [description]`

**Purpose**: Break task into smaller incremental buildouts

**When to Use**:
- Task is large and needs splitting
- Multiple stages of implementation (V1 ‚Üí V2 ‚Üí V3)
- Want to ship incremental progress

**When to Skip**:
- Task is small enough to complete in one go
- No natural splitting points

**Decision**: **Task Structure Rules** (CRITICAL)

**Option 1: Standalone Task** (NO iterations)
- Task has direct action items
- Work is straightforward
- Example: "Migrate constants" with 5 simple steps

**Option 2: Task with Iterations** (NO direct task action items)
- Task has NO direct action items, ONLY iterations
- Complex work split into stages
- Example: "Implement Green Service" ‚Üí Iteration 1: Tier Gen, Iteration 2: Validation

**NEVER: Task with BOTH**
- ‚ùå Don't mix task action items AND iterations
- ‚ùå Creates confusion about what "task complete" means

**Exception**: Pre-Implementation Tasks
- Tasks with iterations CAN have pre-tasks (from brainstorming)
- Pre-tasks completed BEFORE iterations start
- Structure: Task ‚Üí Brainstorming ‚Üí Pre-tasks ‚Üí Iterations

**Output**: Iteration(s) created

**Next Step**: Start implementation (Step 7)

---

#### 7. Implement Iteration

**Command**: `/flow-implement-start`

**Purpose**: Begin coding/building the iteration

**When to Use**: Brainstorming complete (or skipped) and ready to code

**Workflow**:
```
/flow-implement-start
  ‚Üì
Work through action items
  ‚Üì
Check off items as complete
  ‚Üì
Update implementation notes
  ‚Üì
Verify work (tests, manual checks)
  ‚Üì
/flow-implement-complete
```

**Output**: Iteration marked ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Next Step**:
- **More iterations** ‚Üí Add next iteration (Step 6) or implement next (Step 7)
- **All iterations done** ‚Üí Complete task (Step 9)

---

#### 8. Work on Task Action Items (for Standalone Tasks)

**No Command** - Direct implementation

**Purpose**: Complete task without iterations

**When to Use**: Task is standalone (has direct action items, no iterations)

**Workflow**:
```
Work through task action items
  ‚Üì
Check off items as complete
  ‚Üì
Verify work
  ‚Üì
/flow-task-complete
```

**Output**: Task marked ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Next Step**: More tasks (Step 4) or complete phase (Step 10)

---

#### 9. Complete Task

**Command**: `/flow-task-complete`

**Purpose**: Mark task as ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**When to Use**: All iterations/action items done and verified

**What Happens**:
- Task status changes to ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Progress Dashboard updated
- Auto-advances to next task (if available)

**Output**: Task marked complete

**Next Step**:
- **More tasks in phase** ‚Üí Start next task (Step 4)
- **All tasks done** ‚Üí Complete phase (Step 10)

---

#### 10. Complete Phase

**Command**: `/flow-phase-complete`

**Purpose**: Mark phase as ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**When to Use**: All tasks in phase done

**What Happens**:
- Phase status changes to ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Progress Dashboard updated
- Auto-advances to next phase (if available)

**Output**: Phase marked complete

**Next Step**:
- **More phases** ‚Üí Start next phase (Step 3)
- **All phases done** ‚Üí Project complete! üéâ

---

#### 11. Project Complete

**No Command** - All phases done

**What Now?**:
- Create new blueprint for next feature
- Migrate new documentation
- Add new phase to extend current project
- Archive completed work

---

### Decision Trees

```

**Use Brainstorming When**:
- ‚úÖ Architectural decisions needed
- ‚úÖ Multiple implementation approaches
- ‚úÖ Complex edge cases to discuss

    style G fill:#90EE90
    style I fill:#ADD8E6
    style K fill:#D3D3D3
```

**Pre-Implementation Task (Type A)** when:
- ‚úÖ Interface change needed
- ‚úÖ File rename required
- ‚úÖ Bug fix discovered
- ‚úÖ Enum ‚Üí const migration
- ‚úÖ Quick setup work (< 30 min)

**Iteration Action Item (Type D)** when:
- ‚úÖ Building core feature logic
- ‚úÖ Implementing API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Creating UI components
- ‚úÖ Adding validation system
- ‚úÖ Feature work that IS the iteration

---

#### Decision Tree 3: Should This Task Be Standalone or Have Iterations?

```mermaid

    A[Creating Task] --> B{Is task large<br/>or complex?}
    B -->|No| C[STANDALONE TASK]
    B -->|Yes| D{Natural splitting<br/>points exist?}

    F --> I[Add iterations<br/>NO direct action items]

    style C fill:#ADD8E6
    style F fill:#90EE90
```

**Standalone Task** when:
- ‚úÖ Small scope (5-10 simple steps)
- ‚úÖ Single focus (e.g., "Migrate constants")
- ‚úÖ No natural splitting points
- ‚úÖ Can complete in one session

**Task with Iterations** when:
- ‚úÖ Large scope (multi-stage buildout)
- ‚úÖ Complex work (needs design decisions)
- ‚úÖ Natural splitting points (V1 ‚Üí V2 ‚Üí V3)
- ‚úÖ Want incremental shipping

**NEVER**:
- ‚ùå Task with BOTH action items AND iterations
- ‚ùå Creates confusion about completion criteria

<!-- AI_SCAN:BRAINSTORMING_PATTERN:1531-2156 -->
## Brainstorming Session Pattern

### Structure

```markdown
### **Brainstorming Session - [Topic Name]**

**Subjects to Discuss** (tackle one at a time):

1. ‚è≥ **Subject Name** - Brief description
2. ‚è≥ **Subject Name** - Brief description
3. ‚è≥ **Subject Name** - Brief description
   ...

**Resolved Subjects**:

---

### ‚úÖ **Subject 1: [Name]**

**Decision**: [Your decision here]

**Rationale**:

- Reason 1
- Reason 2
- Reason 3

**Options Considered**:

- **Option A**: Description (‚úÖ CHOSEN / ‚ùå REJECTED)
- **Option B**: Description (‚úÖ CHOSEN / ‚ùå REJECTED)

**Resolution Type**: A / B / C / D

**Action Items** (if Type A or D):

- [ ] Action item 1
- [ ] Action item 2
- [ ] Action item 3

---

### ‚úÖ **Subject 2: [Name]**

[Repeat pattern...]
```

### Subject Resolution Types

**Every resolved subject falls into ONE of these types:**

**Type A: Pre-Implementation Task** üîß
- **When**: Decision requires SMALL code changes BEFORE implementing the iteration
- **Scope**: Quick tasks (< 30 minutes), preparatory work, setup - NOT feature building
- **Examples**:
  - Interface/type changes (add field to interface)
  - File renames or moves
  - Bug fixes discovered during brainstorming
  - Enum ‚Üí const migrations
  - Dependency updates
  - Test infrastructure setup
- **Action**: Create new task in "### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**" section
- **Template**:
  ```markdown
  #### ‚è≥ Task [N]: [Name] (PENDING)

  **Objective**: [What this accomplishes]

  **Root Cause** (if bug): [Why this is needed]

  **Solution**: [How to fix/implement]

  **Action Items**:
  - [ ] Specific step 1
  - [ ] Specific step 2

  **Files to Modify**:
  - path/to/file.ts (what to change)
  ```

**Type B: Immediate Documentation** üìù
- **When**: Architectural decision with NO code changes yet
- **Examples**: Design patterns, data structure choices, API contracts
- **Action**: Update Architecture/Design sections in PLAN.md NOW
- **Result**: Decision documented, implementation happens during iteration

**Type C: Auto-Resolved** üîÑ
- **When**: Subject answered by another subject's decision (cascade effect)
- **Examples**: "If we use Pattern X, then Question Y is answered"
- **Action**: Mark as "Auto-resolved by Subject [N]", explain why
- **Result**: No separate action needed, decision flows from parent subject

**Type D: Iteration Action Items** üéØ
- **When**: Decision requires substantial feature work that IS the iteration itself
- **Scope**: Core feature building, NOT preparatory work
- **Examples**:
  - Implementing API endpoints
  - Building UI components
  - Creating validation system
  - Adding error handling logic
  - Developing parser/transformer
  - Building core business logic
- **Action**: Action items become part of iteration implementation (NOT pre-tasks)
- **Distinction**: Pre-tasks are "setup work" (rename, fix, change). Iteration work is "feature building" (implement, create, build).

---

### Decision Matrix: Is This Pre-Task (Type A) or Iteration Work (Type D)?

Ask these questions to determine the correct type:

| Question | Type A (Pre-Task) | Type D (Iteration) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Time to complete?** | < 30 minutes | 30+ minutes |
| **Is this setup/preparation?** | Yes | No |
| **Is this core feature work?** | No | Yes |
| **Can skip without breaking iteration?** | No (blocks iteration) | Yes (IS the iteration) |
| **Examples** | Fix interface, rename file, update enum | Build API, implement validator, create UI |

**Rule of Thumb**:
- ‚úÖ **Pre-Task**: If you can finish it in one coffee break, it's a pre-task
- ‚úÖ **Iteration**: If it's the actual feature you're building, it's iteration work

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:

‚ùå **Don't make iterations into pre-tasks**:
```markdown
BAD:
#### Pre-Implementation Task 1: Implement validation system

GOOD:
Action Items (in iteration implementation):
- [ ] Implement validation system
- [ ] Add error messages
- [ ] Create test cases
```

‚ùå **Don't make pre-tasks into iterations**:
```markdown
BAD:
##### Iteration 2: Rename Blue.ts to BlueService.ts

GOOD:
#### Pre-Implementation Task 1: Rename Blue.ts to BlueService.ts
```

---

### Examples from Real Flow Projects

**RED RPG Skill Generation Project**:
```markdown
Subject 1 (Architecture): Add `foundational: boolean` property to spell tiers
‚Üí Resolution Type: B (Immediate Documentation)
‚Üí Action: Updated architecture section with new property definition
‚Üí Why: Design decision, no code changes yet

Subject 3 (Interface Change): Update I_Tier interface with foundational field
‚Üí Resolution Type: A (Pre-Implementation Task)
‚Üí Action: Created pre-task to update interface (< 5 min work)
‚Üí Why: Small preparatory change needed before building tier generator

Subject 4 (Core Feature): Implement tier generation algorithm with weight constraints
‚Üí Resolution Type: D (Iteration Action Items)
‚Üí Action: Action items added to iteration implementation
‚Üí Why: This IS the iteration - building the core feature

Subject 7 (Bug Fix): Conversion placeholder requires 2+ elements validation
‚Üí Resolution Type: A (Pre-Implementation Task)
‚Üí Action: Created Task 3 with code changes, test cases, files to modify
‚Üí Why: Bug discovered during design, needs fixing before iteration starts

Subjects 2, 5-6: Element semantics, validation rules
‚Üí Resolution Type: C (Auto-Resolved by Subject 1)
‚Üí Action: Marked as "answered by Subject 1's foundational decision"
‚Üí Why: Subject 1's decision cascaded to answer these questions
```

**Payment Gateway Integration Project**:
```markdown
Subject 1 (API Design): REST endpoints structure and authentication
‚Üí Resolution Type: D (Iteration Action Items)
‚Üí Action: Build endpoints as part of iteration
‚Üí Why: Core feature work, substantial implementation effort

Subject 2 (Dependency): Install Stripe SDK
‚Üí Resolution Type: A (Pre-Implementation Task)
‚Üí Action: npm install stripe (2 min task)
‚Üí Why: Quick setup work needed before building integration

Subject 3 (Error Handling Strategy): Retry logic with exponential backoff
‚Üí Resolution Type: B (Immediate Documentation)
‚Üí Action: Document strategy in Architecture section
‚Üí Why: Design decision, actual implementation comes later in iteration
```

### Brainstorming Guidelines

1. **One subject at a time** - Don't overwhelm yourself
2. **Document all options** - Even rejected ones (future reference)
3. **Explain rationale** - Why did you choose this approach?
4. **Choose resolution type** - Type A (Pre-Task), Type B (Documentation), Type C (Auto-Resolved), or Type D (Iteration Work)
5. **Mark resolved** - Use ‚úÖ to track progress
6. **Add subjects dynamically** - New topics can emerge during discussion

### Dynamic Subject Addition

**Subjects are NOT fixed upfront** - you can add new subjects as you work through brainstorming:

```markdown
**Subjects to Discuss**:

1. ‚úÖ **API Design** - RESOLVED
2. üöß **Data Structure** - CURRENT (discussing now)
3. ‚è≥ **Error Handling** - PENDING
4. ‚è≥ **Type Conversion** - NEW (just added!)
5. ‚è≥ **Validation Strategy** - NEW (discovered during Subject 2)
```

**When to Add Subjects**:

- During discussion of current subject, you realize another topic needs addressing
- While resolving one subject, dependencies on other decisions become clear
- When analyzing code/reference, new questions arise
- After resolving a subject, implications suggest new topics

**How to Add**:

1. **IMMEDIATELY update PLAN.md**: Add new numbered item to "Subjects to Discuss" list with ‚è≥ status
2. Mark it as "NEW" or add brief context about why it was added
3. Continue with current subject - don't jump to new one immediately

**IMPORTANT**: Always update the "Subjects to Discuss" list in PLAN.md BEFORE continuing the discussion. This ensures you don't lose track of topics.

**Example**:
```markdown
User: "I now dislike the names... let's think about naming convention"

AI: "Great point! Let me add this as a subject to our brainstorming session first."

[AI updates PLAN.md:]

**Subjects to Discuss**:
1. üöß **Placeholder Detection Strategy** - CURRENT
2. ‚è≥ **Naming Convention** - NEW (emerged during Subject 1 discussion)
3. ‚è≥ **Handler Registration** (Q2 from Subject 1) - DEFERRED

AI: "Added Subject 2: Naming Convention to the list. Now, back to Subject 1..."
```

### Pre-Implementation Tasks During Brainstorming

**IMPORTANT**: When pre-implementation needs are discovered **during brainstorming**, DOCUMENT them immediately but DO NOT implement them yet.

**Workflow**:

1. **During brainstorming** (while discussing subjects)
2. User identifies pre-implementation need (e.g., "we need to create a validation stub in Blue")
3. **AI adds Pre-Implementation Tasks section** to PLAN.md:
   ```markdown
   ### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**

   #### ‚è≥ Task 1: [Description] (PENDING)

   **Objective**: [What this task accomplishes]

   **Action Items**:
   - [ ] Item 1
   - [ ] Item 2
   ```
4. **Continue brainstorming** other subjects
5. **After all subjects resolved** ‚Üí Complete pre-implementation tasks
6. **Mark pre-tasks as ‚úÖ COMPLETE** with verification notes
7. **Then run `/flow-brainstorm-complete`**

**Example During Brainstorming**:

```markdown
User: "Before we continue, create a pre-implementation task to add a validation
      stub in Blue.validateSlotData() that returns true for now."

AI: "Added pre-implementation task. Continuing with Subject 1..."

### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**

#### ‚è≥ Task 1: Create Blue Validation Stub (PENDING)

**Objective**: Add Blue.validateSlotData() method that returns true (placeholder
              for future validation logic)

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add validateSlotData(slotData: I_SlotData): boolean method to Blue.ts
- [ ] Return true (stub implementation)
- [ ] Add TODO comment for future validation logic
- [ ] Create corresponding iteration in PLAN.md for actual implementation

---

[Continue brainstorming subjects...]
```
4. Address new subjects in order after completing current discussion

**Example Flow**:

```
Discussing Subject 2: Parser Architecture
  ‚Üí Realize we need to decide on placeholder syntax first
  ‚Üí Add "Subject 4: Placeholder Syntax Design" to list
  ‚Üí Finish Subject 2 discussion
  ‚Üí Move to Subject 3
  ‚Üí Eventually get to Subject 4
```

**Benefits**:

- Captures insights as they emerge
- Prevents forgetting important topics
- Maintains focus on current subject
- Natural, organic planning process

---

### Subject Resolution Flowchart

After resolving each subject, determine which resolution type applies:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Subject Resolved] --> B{Requires code<br/>changes?}
    B -->|No| C{Architectural<br/>decision only?}
    B -->|Yes| D{Small quick task<br/>&lt; 30 min?}
    C -->|Yes| E[Type B:<br/>Immediate Documentation]
    C -->|No| F{Answered by<br/>another subject?}
    D -->|Yes| G[Type A:<br/>Pre-Implementation Task]
    D -->|No| H[Type D:<br/>Iteration Action Items]
    F -->|Yes| I[Type C:<br/>Auto-Resolved]
    F -->|No| J[Review decision again]

    E --> K[Update Architecture/Design<br/>sections in PLAN.md NOW]
    G --> L[Create pre-task in<br/>Pre-Implementation Tasks section]
    H --> M[Add action items to<br/>iteration implementation]
    I --> N[Mark as resolved by Subject N,<br/>explain why]

    style E fill:#ADD8E6
    style G fill:#FFE4B5
    style H fill:#90EE90
    style I fill:#D3D3D3
```

**Decision Path**:

1. **Does subject require code changes?**
   - **NO** ‚Üí Check if architectural decision only
     - **YES** ‚Üí **Type B** (Immediate Documentation)
     - **NO** ‚Üí Check if answered by another subject
       - **YES** ‚Üí **Type C** (Auto-Resolved)
       - **NO** ‚Üí Review decision (might be Type B or C)
   - **YES** ‚Üí Check if small quick task (< 30 min)
     - **YES** ‚Üí **Type A** (Pre-Implementation Task)
     - **NO** ‚Üí **Type D** (Iteration Action Items)

---

### Using `/flow-brainstorm-review`

**When**: After all subjects are resolved (all marked ‚úÖ)

**Purpose**: Review all brainstorming decisions and suggest follow-up work

**Command**: `/flow-brainstorm-review`

**What It Does**:

1. **Analyzes all resolved subjects** - Reads through all ‚úÖ subjects
2. **Identifies action items** - Extracts all action items from subjects
3. **Categorizes by resolution type** - Groups items by Type A/B/C/D
4. **Suggests follow-up work**:
   - **Type A items** ‚Üí Suggests creating pre-implementation tasks
   - **Type B items** ‚Üí Confirms architecture sections updated
   - **Type C items** ‚Üí Notes auto-resolved dependencies
   - **Type D items** ‚Üí Confirms iteration implementation ready

**Example Output**:

```
üìä Brainstorming Review for Iteration 5:

‚úÖ All 7 subjects resolved!

üì¶ Type A (Pre-Implementation Tasks) - 2 found:
  - Subject 3: Update I_Tier interface with foundational field
  - Subject 7: Fix validation placeholder bug (2+ elements required)

  Suggestion: Create 2 pre-implementation tasks before starting iteration.

üìù Type B (Immediate Documentation) - 1 found:
  - Subject 1: Add `foundational: boolean` property

  Action required: Update Architecture section in PLAN.md with new property.

üîÑ Type C (Auto-Resolved) - 3 found:
  - Subjects 2, 5, 6: Answered by Subject 1's foundational decision

  No action needed - dependencies resolved.

üéØ Type D (Iteration Action Items) - 1 found:
  - Subject 4: Implement tier generation algorithm

  These will be implemented during iteration (main feature work).

üìã Next Steps:
1. Complete Type A pre-tasks (2 tasks)
2. Update Architecture section (Type B)
3. Run `/flow-brainstorm-complete` when done
4. Run `/flow-implement-start` to begin iteration
```

**Benefits**:
- Ensures no action items forgotten
- Clear categorization of follow-up work
- Validates brainstorming completeness before implementation
- Helps decide when to create pre-tasks vs when to implement directly

---

### After Brainstorming: Complete Workflow

**Once all subjects are resolved**, follow this workflow to move from brainstorming to implementation:

#### Step 1: Review Brainstorming Results

**Command**: `/flow-brainstorm-review`

**Actions**:
- Analyze all ‚úÖ resolved subjects
- Identify action items by type (A/B/C/D)
- Determine what work needs to happen

#### Step 2: Handle Type A (Pre-Implementation Tasks)

**If Type A items exist**:

1. Create pre-implementation tasks in PLAN.md:
   ```markdown
   ### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**

   #### ‚è≥ Task 1: [Name] (PENDING)

   **Objective**: [What this accomplishes]

   **Action Items**:
   - [ ] Item 1
   - [ ] Item 2

   **Files to Modify**:
   - path/to/file.ts
   ```

2. Complete each pre-task:
   - Work through action items
   - Mark items as complete ‚úÖ
   - Add verification notes

3. Mark pre-task as ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**If no Type A items**:
- Skip to Step 3

#### Step 3: Handle Type B (Immediate Documentation)

**If Type B items exist**:

1. Update Architecture/Design sections in PLAN.md immediately
2. Document architectural decisions
3. Add design pattern explanations

**If no Type B items**:
- Skip to Step 4

#### Step 4: Verify All Pre-Work Complete

**Check**:
- [ ] All Type A pre-tasks completed (if any)
- [ ] All Type B documentation updated (if any)
- [ ] All Type C auto-resolved subjects documented
- [ ] Type D items identified for iteration implementation

#### Step 5: Complete Brainstorming

**Command**: `/flow-brainstorm-complete`

**What happens**:
- Marks brainstorming session as ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Changes iteration status to üé® READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- Updates Progress Dashboard

**Validation**: Command will ERROR if:
- ‚ùå Unresolved subjects remain (‚è≥ status)
- ‚ùå Pre-implementation tasks incomplete (‚è≥ status)

#### Step 6: Begin Implementation

**Command**: `/flow-implement-start`

**What happens**:
- Changes iteration status to üöß IN PROGRESS (IMPLEMENTING)
- Creates Implementation section in PLAN.md
- Copies action items (mostly Type D items)

**Now**: Work through Type D action items (core feature work)

---

### Complete Brainstorming Example

**Example: Iteration 5 - Tier Generation**

```markdown
### **Brainstorming Session - Tier Generation Design**

**Subjects to Discuss**:
1. ‚úÖ Foundational Property Design

**Action**: Create pre-task to update interface (< 5 min work)

---

### ‚úÖ Subject 4: Validation Bug Fix

**Decision**: Fix placeholder validation requiring 2+ elements

**Resolution Type**: A (Pre-Implementation Task)

**Action**: Create pre-task with bug fix

---

[User runs /flow-brainstorm-review]

AI: "Found 2 Type A tasks, 1 Type B update, 1 Type D implementation.
     Creating pre-tasks..."

---

### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**

#### ‚úÖ Task 1: Update I_Tier Interface (COMPLETE)

**Objective**: Add foundational: boolean field

**Action Items**:
- [x] Add foundational field to interface
- [x] Update type exports

**Verification**: TypeScript compiles with no errors

---

#### ‚úÖ Task 2: Fix Validation Placeholder Bug (COMPLETE)

**Objective**: Require 2+ elements for conversion placeholders

**Action Items**:
- [x] Update validation logic
- [x] Add test case

**Verification**: Test passes

---

[User runs /flow-brainstorm-complete - pre-tasks done ‚úÖ]

AI: "Brainstorming complete! Iteration 5 is üé® READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION"

[User runs /flow-implement-start]

### **Implementation - Iteration 5: Tier Generation**

**Action Items**: See resolved subjects above (Type 2/D items)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implementing generateTiers() method...
- Adding weight-based constraint solver...

[User works through Type D action items - core feature work]
```

**Key Points**:
- **Pre-tasks (A) done BEFORE** `/flow-brainstorm-complete`
- **Documentation (B) updated** during brainstorming
- **Auto-resolved (C) noted** but no action needed
- **Iteration work (D) implemented** after `/flow-implement-start`

---

<!-- AI_SCAN:IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERN:2162-2195 -->
## Implementation Pattern

### Structure

```markdown
### **Implementation - Iteration [N]: [Name]**

**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS / ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Action Items**: See resolved subjects above (Type 2/D items from brainstorming)

**Implementation Notes**:

[Document discoveries, challenges, solutions during implementation]

**Files Modified**:

- `path/to/file.ts` - Description of changes
- `path/to/file.ts` - Description of changes

**Verification**: [How you verified it works - tests, manual checks, etc.]

**Completed**: [Date] (when status is ‚úÖ COMPLETE)

---
```

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Reference action items, don't duplicate** - Action items live in subject resolutions; Implementation section references them
2. **Document progress** - Use Implementation Notes to track what you're doing, challenges, discoveries
3. **Check boxes in subjects** - Mark action items complete in the subject resolutions where they're defined
4. **Verify before completing** - Test/validate your work
5. **Update file list** - Track what changed
6. **No duplication** - Never copy action items to implementation section; use "See resolved subjects above"

---

<!-- AI_SCAN:VERSION_MANAGEMENT:2203-2230 -->
## Version Management

Features can be split into versions:

- **V1**: Minimum viable implementation (simple, functional)
- **V2**: Enhanced implementation (optimizations, edge cases)
- **V3**: Advanced features (rarely needed)

### When to Version

**Use V1 for:**

- Core functionality that must work
- Simple, testable implementations
- Proving the concept

**Defer to V2:**

- Performance optimizations
- Advanced edge cases
- Complex algorithms
- Nice-to-have features

**Mark in Plan:**

```markdown
**V1 Implementation**: [Description]
**V2 Enhancements** (Deferred to Phase 4):

- [ ] Optimization 1
- [ ] Feature 2
```

---

<!-- AI_SCAN:STATUS_MARKERS:2238-2327 -->
## Status Markers

**CRITICAL**: Status markers are **MANDATORY** at every level (Phase, Task, Iteration, Brainstorm, Subject). They are the ground truth for your project state.

### Marker Reference

| Marker | Meaning          | Usage                                           | Documentation Required       | Verification         |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| ‚úÖ     | Complete         | Finished and verified (frozen, no re-verify)    | Completion date              | Skipped (frozen)     |
| ‚è≥     | Pending          | Not started yet                                 | None                         | Verified             |
| üöß     | In Progress      | Currently working on this                       | None                         | Verified             |
| üé®     | Ready            | Brainstorming done, ready to implement          | None                         | Verified             |
| ‚ùå     | Cancelled        | Decided against (task/iteration/subject)        | **WHY** (mandatory!)         | Verified             |
| üîÆ     | Deferred         | Moved to V2/V3/later phase                      | **WHY + WHERE** (mandatory!) | Verified             |

### Required Documentation

**For ‚ùå CANCELLED items:**

Must include reason for cancellation:

```markdown
##### Iteration 8: Custom Retry Logic ‚ùå

**Status**: CANCELLED
**Reason**: SDK already handles retry logic with exponential backoff. Reimplementing would be redundant and error-prone.
**Cancelled on**: 2025-09-30
```

**For üîÆ DEFERRED items:**

Must include reason AND destination:

```markdown
##### Iteration 10: Name Generation üîÆ

**Status**: DEFERRED to Phase 4 (V2)
**Reason**: Requires 124 name components with weighted selection system. Core generation must be proven first.
**Deferred to**: Phase 4, Task 11
**Deferred on**: 2025-10-01
```

### Mandatory Markers

**Every level MUST have a status marker:**

```markdown
### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-09-30

#### Task 1: Setup & Integration ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-09-28

##### Iteration 1: Project Setup ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-09-28

### **Brainstorming Session - API Setup** ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE

**Subjects to Discuss**:
1. ‚úÖ **Credential Management** - RESOLVED
2. ‚ùå **Custom HTTP Client** - REJECTED (SDK is better)
3. üîÆ **Advanced Retry** - DEFERRED to V2
```

### Smart Verification

**Token-efficient validation:**

Commands verify only **active work** (üöß ‚è≥ üé® ‚ùå üîÆ) and skip completed items (‚úÖ):

- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** items = Verified when completed, now frozen (skipped)
- üöß **IN PROGRESS** items = Verify markers match Progress Dashboard
- ‚è≥ **PENDING** items = Verify markers exist
- ‚ùå **CANCELLED** items = Verify reason is documented
- üîÆ **DEFERRED** items = Verify reason and destination documented

**Example:**

```
üîç Verification:
‚úÖ Phase 2 marker: üöß IN PROGRESS ‚úì
‚úÖ Task 5 marker: üöß IN PROGRESS ‚úì
‚úÖ Iteration 6 marker: üöß IN PROGRESS ‚úì

‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped: 15 completed items (verified & frozen)
```

---

## Status Management Best Practices

### Single Source of Truth for Status

**CRITICAL**: Your PLAN.md should have **EXACTLY ONE** authoritative status indicator.

**Where to put status:**
- At the top of the file, in the metadata section
- Format: `**Status**: [Current phase/iteration]`
- Example: `**Status**: Phase 2, Task 5, Iteration 7 - In Progress`

**What NOT to do:**
- ‚ùå Creating multiple "Progress Tracking" or "Current Status" sections
- ‚ùå Adding status summaries at the bottom of the file
- ‚ùå Leaving old status sections when updating to new status

### Maintaining Status in Long-Running Projects

As your project grows (1000+ lines), status management becomes critical:

1. **Update status in-place** - Don't create new status sections, update the existing one at the top
2. **Use status markers** - Let ‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß markers indicate completion, don't duplicate this info
3. **Archive old summaries** - If you create progress summaries, move them to a "Status History" appendix
4. **Use slash commands** - `/flow-status` dynamically reads your PLAN.md and reports TRUE current state

### Status Section Template

```markdown
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Phase 2, Task 5, Iteration 7 - In Progress
**Version**: V1
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03
```

Update `**Status**` and `**Last Updated**` as you progress. **NEVER** add a second status section.

### Verification

Before starting a new AI session or after a long break:

1. Run `/flow-status` - See computed current state from PLAN.md
2. Run `/flow-verify-plan` - Verify PLAN.md matches actual project files
3. Update the `**Status**` line at top if needed

<!-- AI_SCAN:PROGRESS_DASHBOARD:2382-2729 -->
## Progress Dashboard (Required for Complex Projects)

### When to Use

**Required for:**
- ‚úÖ Projects with 10+ iterations across multiple phases
- ‚úÖ V1/V2/V3 version planning with deferred features
- ‚úÖ Long-running development (weeks/months)
- ‚úÖ Large PLAN.md files (2000+ lines)

**Optional for:** Simple 2-3 iteration features (single status line may suffice)

### Purpose

The Progress Dashboard is **your mission control** - a single section at the top of PLAN.md that shows the big picture and points to current work. It works with status markers to create a rigorous progress tracking system:

- **Progress Dashboard** = Always visible pointer + overview (manual)
- **Status Markers** = Ground truth at every level (mandatory)
- **`/flow-status`** = Current position verification (computed, active work only)
- **`/flow-summarize`** = Full structure overview (computed, includes deferred/cancelled)

### Template

Insert this section **after Overview, before Architecture**:

```markdown
## üìã Progress Dashboard

**Last Updated**: [Date]

**Current Work**:
- **Phase**: [Phase 2 - Core Implementation](#phase-2-core-implementation-)
- **Task**: [Task 5 - Error Handling](#task-5-error-handling-)
- **Iteration**: [Iteration 6 - Circuit Breaker](#iteration-6-circuit-breaker-) üöß IN PROGRESS

**Completion Status**:
- Phase 1: ‚úÖ 100% | Phase 2: üöß 75% | Phase 3: ‚è≥ 0%

**Progress Overview**:
- ‚úÖ **Iteration 1-5**: [Grouped completed items] (verified & frozen)
- üöß **Iteration 6**: Circuit Breaker ‚Üê **YOU ARE HERE**
- ‚è≥ **Iteration 7**: Blue Validation
- ‚è≥ **Iteration 8-9**: [Pending work]
- üîÆ **Iteration 10**: Name Generation (DEFERRED to V2 - complexity)

**V1 Remaining Work**:
1. Complete Iteration 6
2. Implement Iteration 7
3. Implement Iteration 9

**V2 Deferred Items**:
1. Iteration 10: Name Generation (moved - complexity)
2. Task 12: Advanced Features (out of V1 scope)

**Cancelled Items**:
1. Task 8: Custom HTTP Client (REJECTED - SDK is better)

---
```

### Key Elements

1. **Jump links** - Navigate to current work in large files using inline markdown links: `[Phase 2 - Core Implementation](#phase-2-core-implementation-)`
2. **YOU ARE HERE** - Crystal clear current position with arrow marker
3. **Completion %** - Quick progress view per phase
4. **Grouped completed items** - Token-efficient (marked "verified & frozen")
5. **Deferred/Cancelled tracking** - Explicit scope decisions with reasons

### Positioning in PLAN.md

```markdown
# [Feature] - Development Plan

> **üìñ Framework Guide**: See DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md

**Created**: [Date]
**Version**: V1

---

## Overview
[Purpose, Goals, Scope]

---

## üìã Progress Dashboard    ‚Üê INSERT HERE (after Overview, before Architecture)

[Dashboard content]

---

## Architecture
[High-level design, components]

---

## Development Plan         ‚Üê STATUS MARKERS AT EVERY LEVEL

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-09-30

#### Task 1: Setup ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
...
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoiding Duplicate Progress Tracking

**IMPORTANT**: The Progress Dashboard is the **ONLY** progress tracking section in your PLAN.md.

**Do NOT create:**
- ‚ùå Separate "Implementation Tasks" section with current phase/iteration
- ‚ùå "Current Status" section elsewhere in the file
- ‚ùå Multiple progress trackers at different locations
- ‚ùå Status pointers like "Search for 'Current Phase' below" (use jump links instead)

**If migrating an existing plan:**
- `/flow-migrate` and `/flow-update-plan-version` will clean up duplicate sections
- Old progress trackers will be removed
- Status pointers will be converted to jump links: `[Progress Dashboard](#-progress-dashboard)`

**Single Source of Truth:**
- **Progress Dashboard** = Always-visible overview with jump links
- **Status Markers** = Ground truth at every level (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ)
- **Commands** = Computed verification (`/flow-status`, `/flow-summarize`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WHERE to Add Iteration Progress (CRITICAL)

**Common Mistake**: When showing task/iteration progress, AIs often create NEW sections ABOVE the Progress Overview instead of updating WITHIN it.

**‚ùå WRONG - Creating New Section Above Progress Overview:**

```markdown
## üìã Progress Dashboard

**Current Task 11 Iterations**:        ‚Üê ‚ùå NEW SECTION (WRONG!)
- Iteration 1: Complete
- Iteration 2: In Progress
- Iteration 3: Pending

**Progress Overview**:                  ‚Üê Existing section ignored
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Complete
- üöß Phase 2: In Progress
  - Task 11: Name Generation
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Update WITHIN Existing Progress Overview:**

```markdown
## üìã Progress Dashboard

**Progress Overview**:                  ‚Üê Update THIS section
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Complete
- üöß Phase 2: In Progress
  - üöß Task 11: Name Generation        ‚Üê Expand this task
    - ‚úÖ Iteration 1: Complete
    - üöß Iteration 2: In Progress
    - ‚è≥ Iteration 3: Pending
```

**Rules for Updating Progress Dashboard:**

1. **NEVER create new sections** above or below Progress Overview
2. **ALWAYS update WITHIN** the existing Progress Overview section
3. **Expand task items** by adding iteration details as indented sub-bullets
4. **Keep it hierarchical**: Phase ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Iterations (indented)
5. **Remove iteration details** when task completes (keep summary only)

**CRITICAL - Iteration List Format (when showing task iterations):**
- **Task line**: `- üöß **Task 11**: Name Generation (3/5 iterations)` ‚Üê Shows iteration count
- **Iteration sub-bullets** (indented under task):
  ```markdown
  - üöß **Task 11**: Name Generation (3/5 iterations)
    - ‚úÖ **Iteration 1**: Basic Templates - COMPLETE
    - ‚úÖ **Iteration 2**: Advanced Placeholders - COMPLETE
    - üöß **Iteration 3**: Validation System - IN PROGRESS ‚Üê **CURRENT**
    - ‚è≥ **Iteration 4**: Testing - PENDING
    - ‚è≥ **Iteration 5**: Optimization - PENDING
  ```
- **Each iteration must be listed** with number, name, and status
- **Update task count** when adding iterations: `(3/5 iterations)` ‚Üí `(3/6 iterations)`

**Example - Showing Iteration Progress:**

When user asks "Show me Task 11's iteration progress in the dashboard", do this:

```markdown
**Progress Overview**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (3/3 tasks)
- üöß Phase 2: Core Features ‚Üê **YOU ARE HERE**
  - ‚úÖ Task 10: Data Structure (complete)
  - üöß Task 11: Name Generation (3/5 iterations)
    - ‚úÖ Iteration 1: Basic name templates
    - ‚úÖ Iteration 2: Advanced placeholders
    - üöß Iteration 3: Validation system ‚Üê **CURRENT**
    - ‚è≥ Iteration 4: Testing & edge cases
    - ‚è≥ Iteration 5: Performance optimization
  - ‚è≥ Task 12: Export system (pending)
```

**NOT this:**

```markdown
## Task 11 - Name Generation Progress    ‚Üê ‚ùå WRONG (new section!)

Current Status: Iteration 3 of 5
- ‚úÖ Iteration 1: Basic name templates
- ‚úÖ Iteration 2: Advanced placeholders
...

**Progress Overview**:                   ‚Üê Original section ignored
- Phase 2: In Progress
```

### Maintaining the Dashboard

**Update triggers:**
- ‚úÖ Completing an iteration
- ‚úÖ Starting new iteration
- ‚úÖ Deferring items to V2 (üîÆ)
- ‚úÖ Cancelling items (‚ùå)

**Maintenance steps:**
1. **Last Updated** - Change date when modifying
2. **‚Üê YOU ARE HERE** - Move to current iteration
3. **Completion %** - Recalculate per phase
4. **Jump links** - Update to current work
5. **Deferred/Cancelled sections** - Add items with reasons

### Verification (Smart & Token-Efficient)

**Hierarchy of truth:**
1. **Status markers** (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ) = Ground truth
2. **Progress Dashboard** = Derived from markers (pointer)
3. **Commands** = Verify dashboard matches markers

**Smart verification (skips completed items):**

Commands verify only **active work**:
- üöß IN PROGRESS - Verify markers match dashboard
- ‚è≥ PENDING - Verify markers exist
- ‚ùå CANCELLED - Verify reason documented
- üîÆ DEFERRED - Verify reason + destination documented
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE - SKIPPED** (verified when completed, now frozen)

**When conflict:**
- Trust status markers (ground truth)
- Update dashboard to match
- Commands warn about mismatch

### Benefits

1. **Always visible** - No command execution, immediately scannable
2. **Token-efficient** - Completed items marked "verified & frozen" (skip re-verification)
3. **Single location** - Lives in PLAN.md (single source of truth)
4. **Navigate large files** - Jump links to current work (critical for 2000+ line files)
5. **Scope clarity** - Deferred/Cancelled sections show evolution
6. **Session continuity** - New AI sessions see full context
7. **Stakeholder friendly** - Copy/paste for reports

### Real-World Example

From a 3747-line game engine PLAN.md:

```markdown
## üìã Progress Dashboard

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03

**Current Work**:
- **Phase**: [Phase 2 - Core Implementation](#phase-2-core-implementation-)
- **Task**: [Task 5 - Green Service](#task-5-green-service-)
- **Iteration**: [Iteration 7 - Blue Validation](#iteration-7-blue-validation-) üöß IN PROGRESS

**Completion Status**:
- Phase 1: ‚úÖ 100% | Phase 2: üöß 95% | Phase 3: ‚è≥ 0%

**Progress Overview**:
- ‚úÖ **Iteration 1-6**: Tier gen, slots, filtering, selection, parsing, integration (verified & frozen)
- üöß **Iteration 7**: Blue Validation (input guards) ‚Üê **YOU ARE HERE**
- ‚è≥ **Iteration 9**: Red API Layer (wraps Blue ‚Üí Green)

**V1 Remaining Work**:
1. Complete Iteration 7 (Blue validation)
2. Implement Iteration 9 (Red wrapper)
3. Phase 3: Testing & iteration

**V2 Deferred Items** (Phase 4):
1. Iteration 8: Name Generation (124 components - complexity)
2. Task 12: 12 new placeholders (conditionals, resources)
3. Task 13: Potency system (stats-based formulas)
4. Task 14: Points & Luck (budget modifiers)
5. Task 15: Database persistence
6. Task 16: Damage variance (¬±10%)
7. Task 17: Game integration

**Cancelled Items**:
None

---
```

**Why this works:**
- Immediately see 95% done, 1 iteration active
- Jump link goes straight to Iteration 7 (in 3747-line file!)
- Completed items marked "verified & frozen" (commands skip them)
- 7 V2 items explicitly deferred with reasons
- Clear "YOU ARE HERE" + next steps

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Multiple Status Sections

**Problem**: In long projects (weeks/months), developers often add "Progress Tracking" sections at the bottom of PLAN.md. Over time, these become stale while the top status is updated, creating conflicting information.

**Example**:
```markdown
# Top of file (line 10):
**Status**: Phase 2, Task 5, Iteration 7 - In Progress

# Bottom of file (line 3600):
## Progress Tracking
Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup (COMPLETE ‚úÖ)
Next Task: Task 5 - Implement Blue (Validator)
```

**Result**: New AI sessions read the stale bottom section and think you're at Iteration 1 when you're actually at Iteration 7.

**Solution**:
- Maintain single status line at top
- Use `/flow-status` to verify current state
- Archive old progress notes to "Status History (Archive)" section if needed

### Pitfall 2: Confusing Tasks vs Iterations

**Problem**: High-level "Tasks" (e.g., Task 7: Implement Green) don't map 1:1 to "Iterations" (Iteration 7: Red Orchestration). This naming overlap confuses status tracking.

**Example**:
- Task 7 is "Implement Green Service"
- Iteration 7 is "Red Orchestration" (different component!)

**Solution**:
- Use `/flow-status` to see the hierarchy clearly
- Status line should show both: `**Status**: Task 7 (Green Service), Iteration 5 (Template Parsing) - Complete`
- Don't rely on numbers alone; include names for clarity

### Pitfall 3: Not Verifying Status at Session Start

**Problem**: When starting a new AI session or compacting conversation, AI may scan PLAN.md and misinterpret current state (especially in 2000+ line files).

**Solution**:
- **ALWAYS** run `/flow-status` at the start of new AI sessions
- Run `/flow-verify-plan` to ensure PLAN.md matches actual code
- Explicitly state to AI: "We're on Iteration X, here's the context"

---

## Pre-Implementation Pattern

Before starting iteration implementation, identify if preparatory work is needed.

### When to Use Pre-Implementation Tasks

Pre-implementation tasks are preparatory work that must be completed BEFORE the main iteration implementation can begin:

- **Refactoring required** - System needs restructuring before new code
- **System-wide changes** - Updates affecting multiple files (e.g., enum ‚Üí const conversion)
- **Data structure updates** - Interface/type changes needed across codebase
- **Bug fixes discovered during brainstorming** - Issues found during design that must be fixed first
- **Dependency changes** - Library updates or new dependencies to add
- **Test infrastructure** - Test setup needed before TDD implementation

### How to Document

Add pre-implementation tasks AFTER brainstorming session, BEFORE implementation:

```markdown
### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**

#### ‚úÖ Task 1: [Description] (COMPLETED)

**Objective**: [What this task accomplishes]

**Changes Made**:

- Change 1
- Change 2

**Verification**: [How verified]

---

#### ‚è≥ Task 2: [Description] (PENDING)

**Objective**: [What this task accomplishes]

**Action Items**:

- [ ] Action item 1
- [ ] Action item 2

---
```

### Completion Rule

**IMPORTANT**: Mark brainstorming session as complete ONLY after all pre-implementation tasks are done.

**Flow**:

1. Complete brainstorming session ‚Üí Create pre-tasks (if needed)
2. Complete all pre-tasks ‚Üí Mark brainstorming ‚úÖ COMPLETE
3. Brainstorming complete ‚Üí Ready for main iteration implementation

---

## Bugs Discovered Pattern

When analyzing reference implementations or during brainstorming, you may discover bugs in existing code. Document these clearly as part of your iteration planning.

### When to Document Bugs

- **During brainstorming** when analyzing reference code
- **When planning refactoring** work
- **As part of pre-implementation tasks**
- **When the bug discovery changes your design decisions**

### How to Document

Add bugs discovered section during brainstorming, typically BEFORE pre-implementation tasks:

````markdown
### üêõ **Bugs Discovered in Original Implementation**

#### Bug 1: [Short Description] (Critical/Major/Minor)

**Location**: `path/to/file.ts:line_number`

**Problem**:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Original code (WRONG):
const result = array[Math.random() * (array.length - 1)];
// Off-by-one error: last element never selected!
```
````

**Fix**:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Corrected code:
const result = array[Math.random() * array.length];
// Now all elements have equal probability
```

**Impact**: Subtle bias in random selection affecting game balance

**Action**: Add to pre-implementation tasks

---

#### Bug 2: [Short Description]

[Repeat pattern...]

````

### Improvements Over Original Pattern

When rewriting/refactoring existing code, document what you improved:

```markdown
### ‚úÖ **Improvements Over Original**

1. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Fixed random selection off-by-one error
   - Corrected prevention logic (.every ‚Üí .some)

2. **Performance**:
   - Single-pass filtering (original used 3 loops)
   - O(1) Set lookups instead of O(n) array searches

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - Removed dead code (unused parameters)
   - Strict TypeScript types (no 'any')

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - Rich error metadata instead of throwing
   - Extensive logging for debugging
   - Public methods for testing

5. **Safety**:
   - Infinite loop protection (max iterations)
   - Weight budget validation
   - Bidirectional constraint checking
````

### Benefits

**Bug Discovery Documentation**:

- Creates audit trail of improvements
- Helps team understand why changes were made
- Prevents reintroducing the same bugs
- Demonstrates thorough analysis

**Improvements Tracking**:

- Shows value of refactoring effort
- Guides future improvements
- Celebrates wins and learnings
- Provides reference for similar work

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Iterations Small

- Target 1-3 days of work per iteration
- Each iteration should be independently testable
- Prefer many small iterations over few large ones

### 2. Brainstorm Before Coding

- ALWAYS brainstorm before implementation
- Document all options, even rejected ones
- Create concrete action items from decisions

### 3. Update the Plan Continuously

- Check boxes as you complete work
- Add notes during implementation
- Document surprises and learnings

### 4. Use Clear Status Markers

- Make it obvious what's done, what's pending, what's in progress
- Use emoji markers consistently (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé®)

### 5. Defer Complexity

- V1 should be simple and functional
- Mark complex features as V2/V3
- Don't over-engineer early iterations

### 6. Validate Before Completing

- Every iteration should be verified (tests, manual checks, etc.)
- Document verification method
- Don't mark complete until proven working

### 7. Learn and Adapt

- Document challenges and solutions
- Track improvements over original implementations
- Apply learnings to future iterations

### 8. Proactively Update PLAN.md

- When using slash commands, PLAN.md updates happen automatically
- When working manually (without slash commands), AI agents should:
  - **Automatically update PLAN.md** after completing significant milestones (iterations, phases, tasks)
  - **Suggest updates** when test results or implementation details should be documented
  - **Check for staleness** - if implementation diverges from plan, update the plan
- The plan file is the source of truth and must stay synchronized with actual progress

### 9. Brainstorming Completion Workflow (CRITICAL)

**When AI resolves subjects naturally** (without using slash commands):

After resolving the LAST subject in brainstorming session:
- ‚úÖ DO: Suggest `/flow-brainstorm-review` to review all decisions
- ‚ùå DON'T: Suggest `/flow-brainstorm-complete` directly

**The correct sequence**:
1. All subjects resolved ‚Üí Suggest `/flow-brainstorm-review`
2. Review creates pre-tasks ‚Üí Work on pre-tasks immediately
3. All pre-tasks complete ‚Üí Suggest `/flow-brainstorm-complete`
4. Brainstorming complete ‚Üí Suggest `/flow-implement-start`

**When pre-implementation tasks exist**:
- If pre-tasks are ‚è≥ PENDING ‚Üí Suggest working on them, NOT `/flow-brainstorm-complete`
- If pre-tasks are ‚úÖ COMPLETE ‚Üí Suggest `/flow-brainstorm-complete`
- NEVER suggest `/flow-brainstorm-complete` if uncompleted pre-tasks exist

**Example natural conversation**:
```
AI resolves last subject ‚Üí marks it ‚úÖ
AI: "All subjects resolved! Next: Use `/flow-brainstorm-review` to review
     all decisions and identify any pre-implementation work needed."

User runs /flow-brainstorm-review
AI: "I recommend creating 3 pre-implementation tasks..."
User: "Yes, create them"
AI creates pre-tasks in PLAN.md

AI: "Pre-tasks created. Let's start with Task 1: [description]. Ready to begin?"
User works on pre-tasks...

All pre-tasks complete ‚Üí AI: "All pre-tasks complete! Use
    `/flow-brainstorm-complete` to mark brainstorming done and move to
    implementation."
```

**Why this matters**: `/flow-brainstorm-complete` will BLOCK if pre-tasks are incomplete. The AI should guide users through the correct workflow to avoid confusion.

### 10. Plan File Size Management

**When PLAN.md becomes too large** (2000+ lines or 10+ completed tasks), it can cause:
- Slow AI processing (token-heavy context)
- Difficult navigation
- Performance bottleneck for slash commands

**Solution**: Use `/flow-plan-split` to archive old completed work while preserving full project history.

#### Recent Context Window Strategy

**Keep in PLAN.md**:
- Current task + 3 previous tasks (regardless of status)
- All non-complete tasks (‚è≥ üöß ‚ùå üîÆ) regardless of age

**Archive to .flow/ARCHIVE.md**:
- All ‚úÖ COMPLETE tasks older than "current - 3"

**Example** (Current = Task 13):
- **Keep**: Tasks 10 ‚úÖ, 11 ‚úÖ, 12 ‚úÖ, 13 üöß (current + 3 previous)
- **Archive**: Tasks 1-9 (only if ‚úÖ COMPLETE)
- **Keep old non-complete**: Task 5 ‚ùå CANCELLED stays in PLAN.md even though old

#### ARCHIVE.md Structure

```markdown
# Project Archive

This file contains completed tasks archived from PLAN.md to reduce file size.

**Archive Info**:
- All content preserved (nothing deleted)
- Organized by Phase ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Iteration
- Reference: See PLAN.md Progress Dashboard for full project history

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03
**Tasks Archived**: 9

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-09-30

#### Task 1: Migrate Constants ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
**File**: `src/core/red/common/consts.ts`

[Full task content including iterations, brainstorming, implementation...]

#### Task 2: Define Enums ‚úÖ

[Full task content...]
```

#### Progress Dashboard with üì¶ Markers

After splitting, Progress Dashboard shows FULL project history with archive markers:

```markdown
**Progress Overview**:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Foundation Setup (complete)
  - ‚úÖüì¶ Task 1: Migrate Constants (archived)
  - ‚úÖüì¶ Task 2: Define Enums (archived)
  - ‚úÖüì¶ Task 3: Define Types (archived)
  - ‚úÖüì¶ Task 4: Refactor Constants (archived)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Core Implementation
  - ‚úÖüì¶ Tasks 1-6: [Names] (archived - outside recent context)
  - ‚úÖ Task 7: Feature X (recent context - full details in PLAN.md)
  - ‚úÖ Task 8: Feature Y (recent context - full details in PLAN.md)
  - ‚úÖ Task 9: Feature Z (recent context - full details in PLAN.md)
  - üöß Task 10: Feature W (current - full details in PLAN.md)
```

**Key insight**: üì¶ marker indicates "details in ARCHIVE.md" but progress record stays in PLAN.md.

#### Phase Headers After Archiving

When all tasks in a phase are archived:

```markdown
### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE (tasks archived)
**Completed**: 2025-09-30
**Tasks**: 4 tasks (üì¶ archived)
```

Phase structure preserved even when content archived.

#### Before/After Example

**Before Split** (PLAN.md at 4,400 lines):
```markdown
### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ

#### Task 1: Migrate Constants ‚úÖ
[150 lines of brainstorming, iterations, implementation]

#### Task 2: Define Enums ‚úÖ
[120 lines of content]

#### Task 3: Define Types ‚úÖ
[180 lines of content]
...
[Tasks 1-9: ~1,800 lines total]
```

**After Split** (PLAN.md at ~2,600 lines):
```markdown
### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE (tasks archived)
**Tasks**: 4 tasks (üì¶ archived)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE (6 tasks archived, 3 kept in recent context)

[Tasks 1-6 removed - ~900 lines saved]

#### Task 7: Feature X ‚úÖ
[Full content - in recent context window]

#### Task 8: Feature Y ‚úÖ
[Full content - in recent context window]

#### Task 9: Feature Z ‚úÖ
[Full content - in recent context window]

#### Task 10: Feature W üöß
[Full content - current task]
```

**Result**: ~1,800 lines archived, 40% reduction, recent context preserved.

#### When to Split

**Guidelines**:
- PLAN.md exceeds 2000 lines
- 10+ completed tasks exist
- Navigation becoming difficult
- AI mentioning large context/token usage

**How to Split**:
1. User runs `/flow-plan-split` when ready
2. Command calculates threshold (current - 3)
3. Archives old completed tasks
4. Updates Progress Dashboard with üì¶ markers
5. Creates/appends to ARCHIVE.md

**No Automation**: Splitting is manual (user controls when it happens). AI can mention file size organically but won't auto-split.

---

## Example: Iteration Lifecycle

### Starting State

```markdown
##### Iteration 4: Affix Selection üöß IN PROGRESS

**Brainstorming Session**:
**Subjects to Discuss**:

1. ‚è≥ Constraint solver algorithm
2. ‚è≥ Prevention rule validation
3. ‚è≥ Weight budget handling
```

### During Brainstorming

```markdown
**Subjects to Discuss**:

1. ‚úÖ Constraint solver algorithm
2. üöß Prevention rule validation (CURRENT)
3. ‚è≥ Weight budget handling

**Resolved Subjects**:

### ‚úÖ Subject 1: Constraint solver algorithm

**Decision**: Use greedy selection with backtracking
**Action Items**:

- [ ] Implement main selection loop
- [ ] Add infinite loop protection
- [ ] Create rich metadata for failures
```

### During Implementation

```markdown
**Implementation - Iteration 4**:

**Action Items**:

- [x] Implement main selection loop
- [x] Add infinite loop protection (MAX_ITERATIONS = 1000)
- [ ] Create rich metadata for failures

**Files Modified**:

- `src/services/Green.ts` - Added generateAffixes() method
```

### Completion

```markdown
##### Iteration 4: Affix Selection ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Implementation Results**:

- 3 methods implemented (196 lines)
- 8 test cases passing
- Weight budget constraint solver working correctly

**Verification**: All 8 tests passed, partial successes expected (constraint solver limiting overpowered combos)
```

---

## Backlog Management

**When PLAN.md contains too many pending tasks that you won't work on soon**, they create noise and consume tokens without adding value to current work. The backlog system lets you move future work out of the active plan while preserving all context.

### Purpose

**Backlog solves the "cluttered plan" problem**:
- You have 9 tasks (1000+ lines) that won't be touched for weeks/months
- These tasks are important (you don't want to delete them)
- But they clutter your active PLAN.md and waste AI tokens
- Solution: Move them to `.flow/BACKLOG.md` temporarily

**Key Insight**: Backlog is for **token efficiency**, not prioritization. Tasks in backlog aren't "low priority" - they're just "not now".

### File Location

`.flow/BACKLOG.md` - Sits alongside PLAN.md and ARCHIVE.md

### Structure

**BACKLOG.md contains**:
1. **Progress Dashboard** - Unnumbered task list (just titles + iteration counts)
2. **Task Sections** - Full task content (exactly as it appeared in PLAN.md, **WITH original task numbers**)

**Example**:

```markdown
# Project Backlog

This file contains tasks moved from PLAN.md to reduce active plan size while preserving all context.

**Backlog Info**:
- Tasks retain original numbers for easy reference
- Full content preserved (brainstorming, iterations, everything)
- Pull tasks back to active plan when ready to work on them

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04
**Tasks in Backlog**: 9

---

## üìã Backlog Dashboard

**Tasks Waiting**:
- **Task 14**: Potency system
- **Task 15**: Points & Luck systems
- **Task 16**: Database persistence
- **Task 17**: Damage variance
- **Task 18**: Game integration
- **Task 19**: Attribute Guarantee - HIGH
- **Task 20**: Context Modifiers - CRITICAL
- **Task 21**: Affix Synergy - MEDIUM
- **Task 22**: Retry Handler - HIGH

---

### Phase 4: Enhancement & Polish (V2)

#### Task 14: Potency system ‚è≥

**Status**: PENDING
**Purpose**: Implement potency scaling system for dynamic spell power

[Full task content with iterations, brainstorming, etc...]

[... Tasks 16-22 ...]
```

### Backlog vs Archive

**Different purposes, different use cases**:

| Aspect | **BACKLOG.md** | **ARCHIVE.md** |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | Reduce active plan clutter (token efficiency) | Historical record (completed work) |
| **Status** | ‚è≥ PENDING tasks (future work) | ‚úÖ COMPLETE tasks (past work) |
| **Temporary?** | YES (tasks move back to PLAN.md) | NO (permanent archive) |
| **Task Numbers** | Keep original numbers | Keep original numbers |
| **When to use** | Too many pending tasks cluttering plan | Old completed tasks no longer relevant |
| **Visibility** | NOT shown in Progress Dashboard | Shown with üì¶ marker in dashboard |

**Example scenario**:
- Phase 4 has Tasks 11-22
- Currently on Task 13
- Tasks 14-22 are pending but won't start for weeks
- **Backlog** Tasks 14-22 (pending future work)
- **Archive** Tasks 1-9 (completed past work)
- **Keep in PLAN.md** Tasks 10-13 (recent context)

### Workflow: Moving to Backlog

**Command**: `/flow-backlog-add <task-number>` or `/flow-backlog-add <start>-<end>`

**What happens**:
1. Remove task from PLAN.md (leaves gap in numbering)
2. Add task to BACKLOG.md (full content, original number)
3. Reset status to ‚è≥ PENDING (fresh start when pulled back)
4. Update BACKLOG.md dashboard

**Example**:

```bash
# Move single task
/flow-backlog-add 14

# Move range
/flow-backlog-add 14-22
```

**Before** (PLAN.md):
```markdown
### Phase 4: Enhancement & Polish

#### Task 13: V2 Placeholders ‚úÖ
[content]

#### Task 14: Potency system ‚è≥
[content - 100 lines]

#### Task 15: Points & Luck ‚è≥
[content - 80 lines]
```

**After** (PLAN.md):
```markdown
### Phase 4: Enhancement & Polish

#### Task 13: V2 Placeholders ‚úÖ
[content]

[Task 14 moved to backlog]
[Task 15 moved to backlog]
```

**BACKLOG.md** now contains Tasks 14-15 with full content.

### Workflow: Viewing Backlog

**Command**: `/flow-backlog-view`

**What happens**:
1. Read BACKLOG.md Progress Dashboard
2. Display task list with numbers

**Example output**:

```
üì¶ Backlog Contents (9 tasks):

Phase 4: Enhancement & Polish (V2)
  - Task 14: Potency system
  - Task 15: Points & Luck systems
  - Task 16: Database persistence
  - Task 17: Damage variance
  - Task 18: Game integration
  - Task 19: Attribute Guarantee - HIGH
  - Task 20: Context Modifiers - CRITICAL
  - Task 21: Affix Synergy - MEDIUM
  - Task 22: Retry Handler - HIGH

Use /flow-backlog-pull <task-number> to move a task back to active plan.
```

### Workflow: Pulling from Backlog

**Command**: `/flow-backlog-pull <task-number> [instruction-text]`

**What happens**:
1. Remove task from BACKLOG.md (completely, no trace)
2. Insert into PLAN.md with **next available task number in active phase**
3. Position according to instruction (or default: after last task in phase)
4. Update BACKLOG.md dashboard

**Examples**:

```bash
# Pull task, insert at end of active phase (default)
/flow-backlog-pull 14

# Pull task, insert after specific task (but renumber sequentially)
/flow-backlog-pull 14 insert after task 13
```

**Numbering behavior**:

If active phase is Phase 4 with Tasks 11, 12, 13:
- Pull Task 14 from backlog ‚Üí becomes **Task 14** (next available number)
- Positioned after Task 13 (default)
- Even if instruction says "after task 13", number is still 14

If active phase is Phase 4 with Tasks 11, 12, 13, and there are 20 tasks total:
- Pull Task 17 from backlog ‚Üí becomes **Task 14** (next in sequence)
- Old Task 17 number discarded
- Always sequential numbering in active phase

**Why renumber?** Keeps active plan clean and sequential. Old task number (from backlog) is just a reference identifier.

### Key Rules

1. **Only full tasks can be backlogged** - No phases, no standalone iterations
2. **Tasks keep original numbers in BACKLOG.md** - Easy reference, no confusion
3. **Tasks get renumbered when pulled back** - Next available number in active phase
4. **Gaps left in PLAN.md numbering** - User can ask AI to renumber if desired (saves tokens otherwise)
5. **Status reset to ‚è≥ PENDING** - Fresh start when pulled from backlog
6. **No dashboard visibility** - Backlog is "out of sight, out of mind" (use `/flow-backlog-view` to see)
7. **Always insert into active phase** - Unless user specifies otherwise in instruction text

### When to Use Backlog

**Use backlog when**:
- ‚úÖ PLAN.md has many pending tasks you won't touch soon (weeks/months away)
- ‚úÖ File size growing but tasks aren't ready to archive (not complete)
- ‚úÖ Want to focus on current work without distraction
- ‚úÖ Token efficiency matters (large context windows)

**Don't use backlog for**:
- ‚ùå Completed tasks ‚Üí Use archive instead
- ‚ùå Tasks starting this week ‚Üí Keep in active plan
- ‚ùå Just 1-2 tasks ‚Üí Not worth the overhead

### Example: Full Backlog Lifecycle

**Scenario**: Phase 4 has Tasks 11-22, currently on Task 13

**Step 1: Move to backlog**
```bash
/flow-backlog-add 14-22
```

**Result**:
- PLAN.md: Tasks 11, 12, 13 (current + 2 recent)
- BACKLOG.md: Tasks 14-22 (future work, 1000 lines)
- Token savings: ~50k tokens per AI request

**Step 2: Complete Task 13, ready for Task 14**
```bash
/flow-task-complete  # Complete Task 13
```

**Step 3: Pull Task 14 from backlog**
```bash
/flow-backlog-pull 14
```

**Result**:
- PLAN.md: Tasks 11, 12, 13 ‚úÖ, 14 ‚è≥ (pulled from backlog, renumbered as 14)
- BACKLOG.md: Tasks 15-22 (8 tasks remaining)

**Step 4: Later, pull Task 15**
```bash
/flow-backlog-pull 15 insert after task 14
```

**Result**:
- PLAN.md: Tasks 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 (Task 15 pulled, becomes 15)
- BACKLOG.md: Tasks 16-22 (7 tasks remaining)

### Commands Summary

## Integration with Slash Commands

This framework is designed to work with slash commands that automate plan file updates.

**Prefix**: All commands use `flow-` prefix to prevent conflicts with other frameworks.

**Total Commands**: 28 commands organized into 7 categories

**Design Principles**:
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Naming**: All separators use hyphens (no underscores)
- ‚úÖ **Symmetric Lifecycle**: Every hierarchy level has add ‚Üí start ‚Üí complete
- ‚úÖ **Clear Intent**: Suffix indicates action (`-add`, `-start`, `-complete`)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Update**: All state-changing commands update Progress Dashboard atomically

---

### 1. Plan Initialization (3 commands)

**Use Case**: Start a new project or migrate existing documentation

- `/flow-blueprint [feature-description]` - **START HERE**: Generate initial PLAN.md with skeleton structure (phases/tasks/iterations). AI will ask for reference implementation, testing methodology, and project constraints.
- `/flow-migrate [file-path]` - Migrate existing PRD/PLAN/TODO to Flow format (creates backup, preserves all content)
- `/flow-plan-update` - Update existing PLAN.md to latest Flow framework structure (moves Progress Dashboard, standardizes markers)

---

### 2. Phase Lifecycle (3 commands)

**Use Case**: Manage top-level project milestones (e.g., "Foundation", "Core Implementation", "Testing")

**Symmetric Triplet** (create ‚Üí start ‚Üí complete):
- `/flow-phase-add [description]` - Create new phase structure in PLAN.md
- `/flow-phase-start` - Mark current phase as üöß IN PROGRESS (when first task starts)
- `/flow-phase-complete` - Mark current phase as ‚úÖ COMPLETE (when all tasks done, auto-advances to next phase)

**Why Symmetric?** Users need explicit control over phase boundaries. "Adding" a phase doesn't mean you're ready to start it.

---

### 3. Task Lifecycle (3 commands)

**Use Case**: Manage work units within a phase (e.g., "Database Schema", "API Endpoints", "Error Handling")

**Symmetric Triplet** (create ‚Üí start ‚Üí complete):
- `/flow-task-add [description]` - Create new task structure under current phase
- `/flow-task-start` - Mark current task as üöß IN PROGRESS (when first iteration starts)
- `/flow-task-complete` - Mark current task as ‚úÖ COMPLETE (when all iterations done, auto-advances to next task)

**Why Symmetric?** Tasks are work units that need clear start/end boundaries, not just structure.

---

### 4. Iteration Lifecycle (6 commands)

**Use Case**: Build a single feature increment through brainstorming ‚Üí implementation

**Symmetric Lifecycle** (create ‚Üí design ‚Üí build ‚Üí complete):
- `/flow-iteration-add [description]` - Create new iteration structure under current task

**Brainstorming Phase** (design before code):
- `/flow-brainstorm-start [optional: topics]` - Begin brainstorming with user-provided subjects (free-form text or interactive)
- `/flow-brainstorm-subject [name]` - Add new subject to discuss during brainstorming
- `/flow-next-subject` - Show next unresolved subject, discuss, capture decision, mark ‚úÖ resolved
- `/flow-brainstorm-review` - Review all resolved subjects, suggest follow-up work (iterations/pre-tasks)
- `/flow-brainstorm-complete` - Close brainstorming, mark iteration as üé® READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (only after pre-tasks done)

**Implementation Phase** (build the code):
- `/flow-implement-start` - Begin implementation, mark iteration as üöß IN PROGRESS (implementing)
- `/flow-implement-complete` - Mark iteration as ‚úÖ COMPLETE, auto-advance to next iteration

**Why Two Phases?** Flow's core value is "design before code" - brainstorming must be distinct from implementation.

---

### 5. Navigation Commands (3 commands)

**Use Case**: Find your way through the plan, understand what's next

**Consistent Pattern** - `/flow-next-X` shows details about next X in sequence:

- `/flow-next` - **Smart universal navigator**: Analyzes PLAN.md state and suggests appropriate next command
  - "What should I do next?" ‚Üí Context-aware suggestion
  - If iteration is ‚è≥ ‚Üí suggests `/flow-brainstorm-start`
  - If iteration is üé® ‚Üí suggests `/flow-implement-start`
  - If iteration is ‚úÖ ‚Üí suggests next iteration or `/flow-iteration-add`

- `/flow-next-subject` - **Brainstorming navigator**: Shows next unresolved subject (‚è≥) in current brainstorming session
  - "What subject should I discuss next?" ‚Üí Displays subject name + description
  - Specific to brainstorming phase

- `/flow-next-iteration` - **Task navigator**: Shows next pending iteration (‚è≥) in current task
  - "What iteration should I work on next?" ‚Üí Displays iteration goal + approach
  - Helps user understand upcoming work

**Relationship**: Work together - run `/flow-next` for suggestion ‚Üí run `/flow-next-iteration` for details

---

### 6. Status & Validation (5 commands)

**Use Case**: Understand project state, verify accuracy, manage context

- `/flow-status` - Show current position (phase ‚Üí task ‚Üí iteration ‚Üí status) + verify Progress Dashboard consistency
  - Smart verification: skips ‚úÖ COMPLETE items (verified & frozen), only checks active work
  - Suggests next action based on current status

- `/flow-summarize` - Generate high-level overview of entire project structure (all phases/tasks/iterations)
  - Bird's eye view with completion percentages
  - Compact format showing completed vs pending work
  - Useful for status reports and V1/V2 planning

- `/flow-verify-plan` - Verify PLAN.md is synchronized with actual codebase state
  - Checks if completed action items actually exist in code
  - Identifies unreported work (modified files not in PLAN)
  - Run before compacting or starting new session

- `/flow-compact` - Generate comprehensive context transfer report for new AI session
  - Zero context loss handoff
  - Includes decisions, progress, challenges, next steps
  - Critical for conversation continuity

- `/flow-rollback` - Undo last change to PLAN.md (limited to one step)
  - Emergency undo for accidental changes
  - Uses changelog to identify last change

---

### 7. Backlog Management (3 commands)

**Use Case**: Manage pending tasks that won't be worked on soon (token efficiency)

- `/flow-backlog-add <task>` or `/flow-backlog-add <start>-<end>` - Move task(s) from PLAN.md to BACKLOG.md
  - Reduces active plan size (1000+ lines ‚Üí backlog)
  - Preserves full task content (iterations, brainstorming, everything)
  - Tasks retain original numbers in backlog for easy reference
  - Leaves gap in PLAN.md numbering (token savings)

- `/flow-backlog-view` - Show backlog dashboard (tasks waiting)
  - Lightweight view of what's in backlog
  - Shows task numbers and names
  - No impact on PLAN.md dashboard (out of sight, out of mind)

- `/flow-backlog-pull <task> [instruction]` - Pull task from backlog back to active plan
  - Renumbers task sequentially in active phase
  - Position based on instruction or default (end of phase)
  - Removes from backlog completely (no trace)
  - Fresh start with ‚è≥ PENDING status

**Key Insight**: Backlog is for **token efficiency**, not prioritization. Tasks aren't "low priority" - they're just "not now" (weeks/months away).

**When to use**:
- ‚úÖ PLAN.md has 9+ pending tasks you won't touch for weeks
- ‚úÖ File size growing but tasks aren't ready to archive (not complete)
- ‚úÖ Want to focus on current work without distraction

**Don't use for**:
- ‚ùå Completed tasks ‚Üí Use `/flow-plan-split` to archive instead
- ‚ùå Tasks starting this week ‚Üí Keep in active plan

---

## Bidirectional Reference System

Flow uses a **three-layer bidirectional reference architecture** to ensure AI agents always consult the framework before making structural changes to PLAN.md. This prevents redundant documentation, enforces consistency, and enables better error recovery.

**Core Principle**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md is the **single source of truth** for all patterns, rules, and conventions. All other documents (PLAN.md headers, CLAUDE.md detection logic, slash commands) **reference** the framework rather than duplicating its content.

---

### The Three Reference Layers

**Layer 1: PLAN.md Header Reference** üîó
- **Location**: Top of every `.flow/PLAN.md` file
- **Purpose**: Warn AI agents to read framework BEFORE editing PLAN structure
- **Audience**: Any AI working with an existing PLAN.md
- **Pattern**: Reference with quick links to critical sections

**Example** (from `/flow-blueprint` and `/flow-migrate`):
```markdown
# Project Name - Development Plan

> **üìñ Framework Guide**: See [DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md](DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md) for methodology and patterns
>
> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Before making structural changes to this PLAN.md, consult DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md to understand:
> - Plan file structure (phases ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí iterations)
> - Status markers (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ)
> - Brainstorming patterns (subject resolution types A/B/C/D)
> - Implementation patterns (pre-tasks, iteration lifecycle)

**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Version**: V1
```

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ Visible at top of every PLAN.md (AI sees it immediately)
- ‚úÖ Links to framework with specific section reminders
- ‚úÖ Prevents structural mistakes (wrong hierarchy, invented markers, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Self-documenting - new contributors see framework reference first

---

**Layer 2: CLAUDE.md Detection Logic** ü§ñ
- **Location**: Project-level `CLAUDE.md` file
- **Purpose**: Auto-detect Flow usage and enforce framework consultation
- **Audience**: AI agents working in ANY project (Flow-enabled or not)
- **Pattern**: IF/THEN detection rules + framework section mapping

**Example** (from Flow's CLAUDE.md):
```markdown
### Automatic Detection

**When working in ANY project, if you detect `.flow/PLAN.md` exists:**

1. **STOP** before making any structural changes to PLAN.md
2. **READ** `DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` from one of these locations (in order):
   - `.flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project-specific)
   - `.claude/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project root)
   - `./DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project root)
   - `~/.claude/flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (global installation)
3. **UNDERSTAND** the framework patterns before editing PLAN.md
4. **FOLLOW** the framework conventions exactly

### Detection Rules

IF file_exists('.flow/PLAN.md'):
    THEN project_uses_flow = TRUE
    THEN read_framework_guide()
    THEN follow_flow_conventions()
```

**Framework Section Mapping Table**:
```markdown
| Task | Framework Section | Lines | What to Learn |
|------|-------------------|-------|---------------|
| Creating new PLAN.md | Plan File Template | 2363-2560 | Template structure, required sections |
| Adding phase | Development Workflow | 567-613 | Phase naming, purpose, scope |
| Adding task | Task Structure Rules | 238-566 | Standalone vs iterations decision |
| Adding iteration | Development Workflow | 567-613 | Iteration goals, action items |
| Starting brainstorm | Brainstorming Session Pattern | 1167-1797 | Subject creation, resolution types |
| Resolving subject | Subject Resolution Types | 1215-1313 | Types A/B/C/D, when to use each |
| Completing iteration | Implementation Pattern | 1798-1836 | Verification, completion criteria |
| Updating status | Status Markers | 1872-1968 | Correct marker usage, lifecycle |
| Lost/confused | Complete Flow Workflow | 614-940 | Decision trees, command reference |
```

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ Automatic - no user action required
- ‚úÖ Applies to ALL projects (global AI behavior)
- ‚úÖ Section mapping provides fast navigation (line numbers!)
- ‚úÖ Catches AI before making structural mistakes

---

**Layer 3: Slash Command Framework References** üìã
- **Location**: Every slash command definition in `framework/SLASH_COMMANDS.md`
- **Purpose**: Point command executors to canonical patterns
- **Audience**: AI agents executing specific Flow commands
- **Pattern**: "Framework Reference" section with line numbers and descriptions

**Example** (from `/flow-task-add`):
```markdown
**Purpose**: Add a new task to the current phase in PLAN.md.

**Framework Reference**: See "Task Structure Rules" section in DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (lines 238-566) for the Golden Rule (Standalone OR Iterations, Never Both), task patterns, and decision guide.
```

**Example** (from `/flow-brainstorm-start`):
```markdown
**Purpose**: Begin a brainstorming session for the current iteration with subjects provided by the user.

**Framework Reference**: See "Brainstorming Session Pattern" section in DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (lines 1167-1797) for complete workflow, subject resolution types (A/B/C/D), and pre-implementation task patterns.
```

**All 25 Commands Have References**:
1. `/flow-blueprint` ‚Üí Plan File Template (2363-2560)
2. `/flow-migrate` ‚Üí Plan File Template (2363-2560)
3. `/flow-task-add` ‚Üí Task Structure Rules (238-566)
4. `/flow-brainstorm-start` ‚Üí Brainstorming Session Pattern (1167-1797)
5. `/flow-implement-start` ‚Üí Implementation Pattern (1798-1836)
6. `/flow-status` ‚Üí Progress Dashboard (2015-2314) + Status Markers (1872-1968)
... (20 more commands - see SLASH_COMMANDS.md for complete mapping)

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ Command-specific guidance (only relevant sections)
- ‚úÖ Line numbers enable fast lookup (jump directly to pattern)
- ‚úÖ Brief descriptions explain what's covered
- ‚úÖ Every command enforces framework consultation

---

### Benefits of Bidirectional References

**1. Prevents Documentation Redundancy** üìù
- ‚ùå **Before**: Commands duplicated framework patterns (inconsistency risk)
- ‚úÖ **After**: Commands reference framework (single source of truth)
- **Result**: Framework updates propagate automatically (no sync needed)

**Example**:
```markdown
# Before (redundant)
## /flow-task-add
**Pattern**: Tasks can be standalone OR have iterations, NEVER both.
Standalone tasks have action items. Tasks with iterations have NO action items...
[300 more lines duplicating Task Structure Rules section]

# After (reference-based)
## /flow-task-add
**Framework Reference**: See "Task Structure Rules" section (lines 238-566)
[Framework contains canonical pattern, command just points to it]
```

---

**2. Self-Documenting Architecture** üèóÔ∏è
- ‚úÖ PLAN.md headers explain what Flow is
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md detection shows how to use Flow
- ‚úÖ Commands point to canonical patterns
- ‚úÖ New contributors understand system by reading references

**Discovery Flow**:
```
User opens PLAN.md
  ‚Üí Sees framework reference header at top
  ‚Üí Reads DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md to understand structure
  ‚Üí Uses slash commands (which also reference framework)
  ‚Üí Makes correct structural changes (framework-aware)
```

---

**3. Better Error Recovery** üîß
- AI agents can "recover" from mistakes by re-reading framework
- Section mapping table (Layer 2) provides fast navigation
- Line numbers enable precise lookup (no searching needed)

**Example Recovery Scenario**:
```
AI creates task with BOTH action items AND iterations (‚ùå wrong)
  ‚Üì
User: "This violates the Golden Rule"
  ‚Üì
AI: *reads Task Structure Rules (238-566)*
  ‚Üì
AI: "You're right - Task Structure Rules line 240 says 'Standalone OR Iterations, Never Both'"
  ‚Üì
AI: *fixes structure* (converts to proper pattern)
```

---

**4. Enforces Consistency Across Sessions** üîÑ
- Different AI agents always consult same framework
- No "drift" in interpretation of Flow patterns
- Framework version tracks with plan file

**Cross-Session Consistency**:
```
Session 1 (AI Agent A): Creates task using Task Structure Rules (238-566)
Session 2 (AI Agent B): Edits same task, reads same section (238-566)
Result: Both agents follow identical pattern (no inconsistency)
```

---

### Implementation Timeline

**Iteration 1** (Design): ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Brainstormed bidirectional reference approach
- Chose Option E (three-layer system)
- Planned Iterations 2-6

**Iteration 2** (PLAN Header): ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Added framework reference header to `/flow-blueprint` command
- Added framework reference header to `/flow-migrate` command
- Result: All new PLAN.md files now include reference header

**Iteration 3** (CLAUDE.md Detection): ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Added "Flow Framework Integration" section to CLAUDE.md (~126 lines)
- Included detection rules, section mapping table, behavior expectations
- Result: AI auto-detects Flow usage and consults framework

**Iteration 4** (Command References): ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Added "Framework Reference" section to all 25 slash commands
- Each reference includes: section name, line range, brief description
- Result: Every command now points to canonical framework pattern

**Iteration 5** (Documentation): üöß IN PROGRESS
- Document the bidirectional reference system (this section!)
- Explain three layers, benefits, implementation timeline
- Result: Framework documents its own reference architecture

**Iteration 6** (Build Validation): ‚è≥ PENDING
- Add validation to `build-standalone.sh`
- Verify all commands have valid framework references
- Fail build if line numbers are invalid or references missing

---

### Usage Guidelines for AI Agents

**When you see `.flow/PLAN.md`**:
1. ‚úÖ **DO** read DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md before structural changes
2. ‚úÖ **DO** use section mapping table to find relevant patterns
3. ‚úÖ **DO** cite framework sections when explaining patterns (e.g., "Task Structure Rules line 240 says...")
4. ‚úÖ **DO** trust framework as source of truth (not memory/assumptions)

**When executing slash commands**:
1. ‚úÖ **DO** read the Framework Reference section in command definition
2. ‚úÖ **DO** jump to specified line numbers in DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md
3. ‚úÖ **DO** follow framework patterns exactly (don't invent variations)
4. ‚úÖ **DO** update PLAN.md according to framework conventions

**When recovering from errors**:
1. ‚úÖ **DO** re-read framework section for the pattern you violated
2. ‚úÖ **DO** explain what you learned from framework (quote line numbers)
3. ‚úÖ **DO** fix mistake according to canonical pattern
4. ‚úÖ **DO** verify fix matches framework convention

---

### Cross-References

**Related Framework Sections**:
- **Framework Structure** (lines 105-179) - Complete hierarchy and required sections
- **Task Structure Rules** (lines 238-566) - Golden Rule, standalone vs iterations
- **Brainstorming Session Pattern** (lines 1167-1797) - Subject resolution workflow
- **Implementation Pattern** (lines 1798-1836) - Pre-tasks, iteration lifecycle
- **Status Markers** (lines 1872-1968) - All 7 markers with lifecycle rules
- **Quick Reference Guide** (lines 3223-3602) - Decision trees, command cheat sheet

**Related Files**:
- `.flow/PLAN.md` - Contains framework reference header (Layer 1)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Contains detection rules and section mapping (Layer 2)
- `framework/SLASH_COMMANDS.md` - Contains command-level references (Layer 3)

---

## Command Usage Flow

**Typical workflow for a new iteration**:

```
1. /flow-iteration-add "Feature name"
2. /flow-brainstorm-start "API design, database schema, auth flow, testing strategy"
   (AI extracts 4 subjects from your input)
3. /flow-next-subject
   (discuss first subject, AI captures decision and marks ‚úÖ resolved)
4. /flow-next-subject
   (repeat for remaining subjects)
5. /flow-brainstorm-review
   (review all decisions, AI suggests creating iterations/pre-tasks for major work)
6. User creates follow-up work based on review suggestions
7. /flow-brainstorm-complete
8. /flow-implement-start
9. Work through action items, check off as complete
10. /flow-implement-complete
11. /flow-status (verify and move to next iteration)
```

**Helper commands at any time**:
- `/flow-status` - Where am I?
- `/flow-next` - What should I do?
- `/flow-next-iteration` - What's coming next?

---

## Command Design Rationale

**Why 25 commands instead of fewer?**
- Explicit is better than implicit - users want clear control
- Symmetric naming is predictable and discoverable
- Each command has single responsibility (no overloading)

**Why hyphens instead of underscores?**
- Standard in CLI tools (kubectl, docker, gh, npm)
- Consistent with existing Flow commands
- Easier to type and read

**Why `-add` suffix for structure commands?**
- Makes intent crystal clear ("I'm creating new structure, not starting work")
- Distinguishes from `-start` (begin work) and `-complete` (finish work)
- Eliminates confusion about command purpose

**Why auto-update Progress Dashboard?**
- Dashboard is "mission control" - must NEVER be stale
- Manual updates lead to inconsistency
- Real-time state is core Flow promise

## Quick Reference Guide

### Decision Tree 4: What Subject Resolution Type Is This?

When resolving a brainstorming subject, use this tree to determine the correct resolution type:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Resolved Subject] --> B{Does this require<br/>code changes?}
    B -->|No| C{Is this architectural<br/>documentation only?}
    B -->|Yes| D{Is this answered by<br/>another subject?}
    C -->|Yes| E[TYPE B<br/>Immediate Documentation]
    C -->|No| F{Decision cascades<br/>from other subject?}
    D -->|Yes| G[TYPE C<br/>Auto-Resolved]
    D -->|No| H{Is this small<br/>preparatory work?}
    F -->|Yes| G
    F -->|No| E
    H -->|Yes| I{Can complete<br/>in &lt; 30 min?}
    H -->|No| J[TYPE D<br/>Iteration Action Item]
    I -->|Yes| K[TYPE A<br/>Pre-Implementation Task]
    I -->|No| J

    style K fill:#FFE4B5
    style E fill:#ADD8E6
    style G fill:#D3D3D3
    style J fill:#90EE90
```

**Type A: Pre-Implementation Task** üîß
- Small code changes (< 30 min)
- Preparatory work before iteration
- Examples: Fix interface, rename file, migrate enum
- Action: Create pre-task, complete BEFORE `/flow-brainstorm-complete`

**Type B: Immediate Documentation** üìù
- Architectural decision, no code yet
- Design pattern choice, API contract
- Examples: Choose architecture, define schema
- Action: Update Architecture/Design section NOW

**Type C: Auto-Resolved** ‚Ü™Ô∏è
- Answered by another subject's decision
- Cascade decisions
- Examples: "Database choice" resolved by "Use PostgreSQL"
- Action: Mark resolved, reference deciding subject

**Type D: Iteration Action Items** üéØ
- Substantial feature work that IS the iteration
- Core feature building
- Examples: Implement validator, build API, create UI
- Action: Action items become iteration implementation (after `/flow-implement-start`)

    style F fill:#FFE4B5
    style T fill:#ADD8E6
    style L fill:#90EE90
    style O fill:#FFD700
```

**Key Decision Points**:

1. **No PLAN.md yet?** ‚Üí Start with `/flow-blueprint` or `/flow-migrate`
2. **Phase ‚è≥ PENDING?** ‚Üí Run `/flow-phase-start`
3. **Task üöß IN PROGRESS but no brainstorm?** ‚Üí Decide: brainstorm or direct work
4. **Brainstorm subjects ‚è≥?** ‚Üí Run `/flow-next-subject` until all resolved
5. **All subjects ‚úÖ?** ‚Üí Run `/flow-brainstorm-review` then handle pre-tasks
6. **Iteration üé® READY?** ‚Üí Run `/flow-implement-start`
7. **Iteration üöß IN PROGRESS?** ‚Üí Complete action items then `/flow-implement-complete`

**Lost? Run these commands**:
- `/flow-status` - See exactly where you are
- `/flow-next` - Get AI's suggestion for next step
- `/flow-next-iteration` - Preview what's coming next

### Status Marker Reference

Flow uses emoji status markers throughout the PLAN.md to track progress at every level (phases, tasks, iterations, action items, subjects).

| Marker | Name | Meaning | Typical Usage |
|--------|------|---------|---------------|

## Architecture

**High-Level Design**:
- Service-oriented architecture with dedicated `PaymentService`
- Webhook processor as separate background job
- Transaction state machine for payment lifecycle management
- Event-driven notifications for payment status changes

**Key Components**:
1. **PaymentService** - Core payment processing logic
2. **MockPayAdapter** - Third-party API integration layer
3. **WebhookProcessor** - Handles async payment notifications
4. **TransactionRepository** - Persists payment records
5. **PaymentEventEmitter** - Publishes payment events to message bus

**Dependencies**:
- MockPay Node.js SDK (v3.2.1)
- Express.js for webhook endpoints
- Redis for webhook deduplication
- PostgreSQL for transaction storage

---

## Testing Strategy

**Methodology**: Integration tests + Manual QA

**Approach**:
- **Integration Tests**: Created after each iteration using Jest
- **Location**: `tests/integration/payment/` directory
- **Naming Convention**: `{feature}.integration.test.ts` (e.g., `payment-creation.integration.test.ts`)
- **When to create**: After iteration implementation complete and working, if test file doesn't exist
- **When to add**: If test file already exists for the feature, add new test cases to existing file
- **Coverage**: Focus on happy path + critical error cases (insufficient funds, network errors, webhook failures)
- **Manual QA**: Final end-to-end verification in staging environment before deployment

**Test Execution**:
```bash
npm run test:integration                 # Run all integration tests
npm run test:integration:payment         # Payment tests only
```

**File Structure**:
```
tests/integration/payment/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payment-creation.integration.test.ts       # Payment creation tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webhook-handling.integration.test.ts       # Webhook tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ payment-retry.integration.test.ts          # Retry logic tests (create if new feature)
```

**Verification Per Iteration**:
Each iteration's "Verification" section will include:
1. Integration test file created (if new feature) or updated (if enhancement)
2. Test cases passing (list specific scenarios)
3. Manual QA checklist (if applicable)

**IMPORTANT**:
- ‚úÖ Create `tests/integration/payment/new-feature.integration.test.ts` for new features
- ‚úÖ Add test cases to existing files for enhancements to existing features
- ‚ùå Do NOT create tests before implementation (we write tests after code works)
- ‚ùå Do NOT create unit tests (focus on integration tests only)

**Why This Approach**:
- Integration tests catch real API interaction issues
- Writing tests after implementation allows for faster prototyping
- Manual QA ensures user experience quality before production

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation üöß

**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Started**: 2025-10-01
**Completed**: (in progress)

**Strategy**: Set up core infrastructure and basic payment flow

**Goal**: Enable simple payment processing without advanced features

---

#### Task 1: Setup & API Integration ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-10-01
**Purpose**: Establish connection to MockPay and implement basic payment creation

---

##### Iteration 1: Project Setup & SDK Integration ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-10-01
**Goal**: Install dependencies and configure MockPay credentials

---

### **Brainstorming Session - API Setup** ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE

**Subjects to Discuss**:

1. ‚úÖ **Credential Management** - RESOLVED
2. ‚úÖ **SDK vs Raw HTTP** - RESOLVED
3. ‚úÖ **Environment Configuration** - RESOLVED
4. ‚ùå **Custom HTTP Client** - REJECTED (SDK is sufficient)

**Resolved Subjects**:

---

### ‚úÖ **Subject 1: Credential Management**

**Decision**: Use environment variables with .env file + secret manager in production

**Resolution Type**: B (Immediate Documentation)

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard approach (12-factor app)
- Easy to rotate credentials without code changes
- Prevents accidental commits of secrets to git
- Integrates well with deployment pipelines

**Options Considered**:
- **Option A**: Hardcoded in config files ‚ùå REJECTED (security risk)
- **Option B**: Environment variables ‚úÖ CHOSEN
- **Option C**: Database configuration ‚ùå REJECTED (chicken-egg problem for DB credentials)

**Action Items**:
- [x] Add `MOCKPAY_API_KEY` and `MOCKPAY_SECRET` to .env.example
- [x] Create .env file and add to .gitignore
- [x] Document credential setup in README.md
- [x] Add validation on startup to ensure credentials are present

---

### ‚úÖ **Subject 2: SDK vs Raw HTTP**

**Decision**: Use official MockPay SDK for V1, abstract behind adapter pattern

**Resolution Type**: D (Iteration Action Items)

**Rationale**:
- SDK handles authentication, retries, and rate limiting automatically
- Reduces development time for V1
- Adapter pattern allows swapping to custom HTTP client later if needed
- SDK is well-maintained (last updated 2 weeks ago)

**Options Considered**:
- **Option A**: Raw HTTP with axios ‚ùå REJECTED (reinventing the wheel)
- **Option B**: Official SDK with adapter pattern ‚úÖ CHOSEN
- **Option C**: Third-party wrapper library ‚ùå REJECTED (adds extra dependency)

**Action Items**:
- [x] Install `@mockpay/node-sdk@3.2.1`
- [x] Create `MockPayAdapter` class implementing `PaymentGatewayInterface`
- [x] Add TypeScript types for adapter methods
- [x] Write unit tests for adapter initialization

---

### ‚úÖ **Subject 3: Environment Configuration**

**Decision**: Use NODE_ENV with separate .env files per environment

**Resolution Type**: B (Immediate Documentation)

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Standard Node.js convention
- Easy to understand for new developers
- Works well with CI/CD pipelines

**Action Items**:
- [x] Create .env.development, .env.staging, .env.production templates
- [x] Add dotenv-flow package for automatic env file loading
- [x] Document environment setup in CONTRIBUTING.md

---

### ‚ùå **Subject 4: Custom HTTP Client**

**Status**: REJECTED

**Reason**: Building custom HTTP client would duplicate functionality already provided by MockPay SDK. SDK handles authentication, retry logic with exponential backoff, rate limiting, and request signing automatically. Reimplementing these features would be time-consuming and error-prone.

**Decision**: Use MockPay SDK (Subject 2) instead. If custom HTTP implementation is needed later (e.g., for performance optimization or multi-provider abstraction), it can be added in V2 behind the existing adapter interface.

**Rejected on**: 2025-10-01

---

### **Implementation - Iteration 1** ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-10-01

**Action Items**: See resolved subjects above (Subjects 1, 2, 3 - all Type B/D items completed)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Discovered MockPay SDK sandbox mode - added `MOCKPAY_SANDBOX=true` for dev
- Added health check endpoint `/api/payment/health` for connectivity testing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/adapters/MockPayAdapter.ts` - Adapter implementation (127 lines)
- `src/config/mockpay.ts` - Config loader with validation
- `tests/unit/MockPayAdapter.test.ts` - 8 test cases
- Environment setup: .env.example, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md

**Verification**: All 8 unit tests passing. Connected to MockPay sandbox successfully.

**Completed**: 2025-10-01

---

##### Iteration 2: Payment Creation Flow üöß IN PROGRESS

**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Implement API endpoints and service methods to create payment intents

---

### **Brainstorming Session - Payment Flow Design**

**Subjects to Discuss**:

1. ‚úÖ **API Endpoint Structure** - RESTful design for payment operations
2. ‚úÖ **Payment State Machine** - Lifecycle management (pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí complete)
3. üöß **Error Handling Strategy** - How to handle API failures gracefully (CURRENT)
4. ‚è≥ **Idempotency Keys** - Preventing duplicate charges

**Resolved Subjects**:

---

### ‚úÖ **Subject 1: API Endpoint Structure**

**Decision**: Use REST with POST /api/payments to create payment intents

**Resolution Type**: B (Immediate Documentation)

**Rationale**:
- Standard RESTful convention (POST = create resource)
- Returns payment intent ID that frontend can use with SDK
- Separation of concerns: backend creates intent, frontend confirms
- Aligns with MockPay's recommended integration pattern

**Options Considered**:
- **Option A**: Single endpoint `/api/pay` that does everything ‚ùå REJECTED (too much coupling)
- **Option B**: POST `/api/payments` to create intent, PUT `/api/payments/:id/confirm` to complete ‚úÖ CHOSEN
- **Option C**: GraphQL mutation ‚ùå REJECTED (overkill for V1)

**Action Items**:
- [x] Define OpenAPI spec for POST /api/payments
- [x] Create Express router for payment endpoints
- [x] Add request validation middleware (amount, currency, metadata)
- [x] Implement PaymentService.createPaymentIntent() method

---

### ‚úÖ **Subject 2: Payment State Machine**

**Decision**: Use enum-based state machine with explicit transitions

**Resolution Type**: D (Iteration Action Items)

**Rationale**: Explicit state transitions prevent invalid states, easier debugging, foundation for V2 refunds

**States**: `PENDING ‚Üí PROCESSING ‚Üí COMPLETED | FAILED | CANCELLED` (+ REFUNDING/REFUNDED in V2)

**Action Items**:
- [x] Create PaymentStatus enum with state transition validation
- [x] Add timestamps (created_at, updated_at, status_changed_at)
- [x] Create database migration for payment_transactions table

---

### üöß **Subject 3: Error Handling Strategy** (CURRENT)

**Decision**: [To be resolved]

**Discussion in progress...**

Options being considered:
- **Option A**: Return generic errors to frontend, log details server-side
- **Option B**: Return detailed error codes that frontend can map to user messages
- **Option C**: Return both error code + safe message

Need to decide:
- How much detail to expose to frontend?
- What error codes do we need? (INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS, CARD_DECLINED, NETWORK_ERROR, etc.)
- Should we retry automatically or let user retry?

---

### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**

#### ‚úÖ Task 1: Refactor Config Module (COMPLETED)

**Objective**: Refactor config module to support nested configuration for payment settings

**Changes**: Migrated to hierarchical structure, updated 23 test files, added TypeScript interfaces

**Verification**: All 187 tests passing

---

#### ‚è≥ Task 2: Add Request ID Middleware (PENDING)

**Objective**: Add request ID tracking for debugging payment flows

**Action Items**: Install express-request-id, add middleware, update logger

---

### **Implementation - Iteration 2**

**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS

**Action Items**: See resolved subjects above (Subjects 1, 2 - Type D items; Subject 3 in progress)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Created basic payment creation flow (happy path working)
- Error handling strategy still being resolved (Subject 3 in progress)

**üö® Scope Boundary Example**: Discovered bug in `UserAuth.validateToken()` (doesn't check expiration). Instead of fixing immediately:
1. STOPPED implementation
2. NOTIFIED user - not part of Iteration 2 scope
3. User decided: Create pre-implementation task for Iteration 3
4. Documented bug, stayed focused on payment flow

**Why this matters**: Prevents scope creep, keeps iterations focused, tracks all changes intentionally.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/PaymentService.ts` - Core logic (143 lines, partial)
- `src/routes/payment.routes.ts` - API routes (78 lines)
- Database migration, API spec

**Verification**: Manual testing successful. Automated tests pending error handling completion.

## Future Enhancements (V2+)

**Deferred to V2/V3**:
- [ ] Multi-provider support (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- [ ] Saved payment methods with tokenization
- [ ] Subscription billing engine
- [ ] Partial and split refunds
- [ ] Payment dispute management
- [ ] ML-based fraud detection
- [ ] Apple Pay / Google Pay integration
- [ ] International payment methods (Alipay, WeChat Pay)

---

## Notes & Learnings

**Design Decisions**:
- **Adapter pattern for gateway**: Allows swapping payment providers in V2 without rewriting business logic
- **State machine for payments**: Explicit transitions prevent invalid states and make debugging easier
- **Sandbox mode by default**: Discovered during implementation, prevents accidental charges in dev

**Challenges Encountered**:
- **Config refactoring needed**: Had to refactor config module before adding payment config (added as pre-implementation task)
- **MockPay SDK quirks**: SDK requires explicit sandbox flag, not documented clearly in their main guide

**Improvements Over Original** (if refactoring):
- N/A - This is a new feature implementation

---

## Changelog

**2025-10-01**:
- ‚úÖ Iteration 1: MockPay SDK integration, adapter pattern, 8 unit tests
- üöß Iteration 2: Payment flow design, state machine, basic endpoint (in progress)
