# Flow Framework - Slash Commands

This file contains all slash command definitions for the Flow framework. Copy these to `.claude/commands/` when ready to use.

---

## Command Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Every command must:

1. **Read the framework guide** at the start to understand patterns and structure
2. **Find and parse PLAN.md** to understand current state
3. **Follow framework patterns exactly** (status markers, section structure, etc.)
4. **Update PLAN.md** according to framework conventions
5. **Provide clear next steps** to the user

**Framework Location**: `DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (searches in: `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)

**Status Markers** (use consistently):
- ✅ Complete
- ⏳ Pending
- 🚧 In Progress
- 🎨 Ready for Implementation
- ❌ Rejected
- 🔮 Future/Deferred

---

## /flow-blueprint

**File**: `flow-blueprint.md`

```markdown
You are executing the `/flow-blueprint` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Generate initial PLAN.md file with skeleton structure for a new feature/project/bug/issue.

**Instructions**:

1. **Read the framework guide**:
   - Search for DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md in these locations (in order):
     - `.claude/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `./DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project root)
     - `~/.claude/flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (global)
   - Read the first found location
   - Understand the hierarchy: PHASE → TASK → ITERATION → BRAINSTORM → IMPLEMENTATION
   - Study the plan file template section
   - Note the status markers and section structure

2. **Analyze the feature request**: `$ARGUMENTS`

3. **Check for reference implementation**:
   - If user mentioned a reference path in arguments, use it
   - Otherwise, ask: "Do you have a reference implementation I should analyze? (Provide path or say 'no')"
   - If reference provided, read and analyze it to inform the planning

4. **Generate PLAN.md** in current directory following the framework template:
   - **Overview section**: Purpose, goals, scope
   - **Architecture section**: High-level design, key components
   - **Development Plan**:
     - Estimate 2-4 phases (Foundation, Core Implementation, Testing, Enhancement/Polish)
     - For each phase: 1-5 tasks
     - For each task: 2-10 iterations (high-level names only)
     - Mark everything as ⏳ PENDING
     - Add placeholder brainstorming sessions (empty subject lists)

5. **Depth**: Medium detail
   - Phase names and strategies
   - Task names and purposes
   - Iteration names only (no brainstorming subjects yet)

6. **Confirm to user**:
   - "Created PLAN.md with [X] phases, [Y] tasks, [Z] iterations"
   - "Use `/flow-status` to see current state"
   - "Use `/flow-brainstorm_start [topic]` to begin first iteration"

**Output**: Create PLAN.md file and confirm creation to user.

## /flow-status

**File**: `flow-status.md`

```markdown
You are executing the `/flow-status` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Show current position in the plan.

**Instructions**:

1. **Find PLAN.md**: Look in current directory, traverse up if needed

2. **Check for conflicting status sections**:
   - Search for patterns like "Progress Tracking", "Current Status", "Status Summary"
   - Look for multiple "**Status**:" lines in the file
   - Check if status at top of file conflicts with status sections elsewhere
   - If multiple status sections found:
     ```
     ⚠️  WARNING: Multiple status sections detected!

     Found status indicators at:
     - Line [N]: **Status**: [value]
     - Line [N]: ## Progress Tracking

     This violates Flow's "Single Source of Truth" principle.
     The authoritative status is at the TOP of PLAN.md.
     Consider archiving or removing stale status sections.
     ```

3. **Parse PLAN.md** to extract:
   - Current phase (last phase with ⏳ or 🚧 or 🎨)
   - Current task (last task with ⏳ or 🚧 or 🎨)
   - Current iteration (last iteration with ⏳ or 🚧 or 🎨)
   - Current status emoji and state

         └─ Iteration [N]: [Name] [Status]

   Next Action: [Suggest next command based on status]
   ```

5. **Suggest next action**:
   - If ⏳ PENDING → "Use `/flow-brainstorm_start [topic]` to begin"
   - If 🚧 IN PROGRESS (brainstorming) → "Continue resolving subjects with `/flow-brainstorm_resolve`"
   - If 🎨 READY → "Use `/flow-implement_start` to begin implementation"
   - If 🚧 IN PROGRESS (implementing) → "Work through action items, use `/flow-implement_complete` when done"
   - If ✅ COMPLETE → "Use `/flow-iteration [description]` to start next iteration"

6. **Show progress summary**:
   - Count completed vs total iterations
   - Count completed vs total tasks

## /flow-summarize

**File**: `flow-summarize.md`

```markdown
You are executing the `/flow-summarize` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Generate high-level overview of entire project structure and completion state.

**Context**:
- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: PLAN.md (current project)
- **Use case**: "Bird's eye view" of project health, progress across all phases, quick status reports

**Comparison to other commands**:
- `/flow-status` = "Where am I RIGHT NOW?" (micro view - current iteration)
- `/flow-summarize` = "What's the WHOLE PICTURE?" (macro view - all phases/tasks/iterations)
- `/flow-verify-plan` = "Is this accurate?" (validation)
- `/flow-compact` = "Transfer full context" (comprehensive handoff)

**Instructions**:

1. **Find PLAN.md**: Look in current directory, traverse up if needed

2. **Parse entire PLAN.md structure**:
   - Extract Version (from metadata at top)
   - Extract current Status line (from metadata)
   - Parse ALL phases with their status markers
   - For each phase, parse ALL tasks
   - For each task, parse ALL iterations
   - Track completion percentages at each level

3. **Generate structured summary** (compact, scannable format):

   ```
   📊 Flow Summary

   Version: [V1/V2/V3]
   Status: [Current phase/task/iteration from metadata]

   Phase [N]: [Name] [Status] [%]
   - Task [N]: [Name] [Status]
     - Iter [N-N] [Status]: [Concise description]
     - Iter [N] 🚧 CURRENT: [What you're working on]
     - Iter [N] ⏳: [What's next]

   Phase [N]: [Name] [Status] [%]
   - Task [N-N]: [Grouped if similar] [Status]
   - Task [N]: [Name] [Status]

   Deferred to V2:
   - [Iteration/feature name]
   - [Iteration/feature name]

   ---
   TL;DR: [One punchy sentence about overall state]
   ```

4. **Formatting rules**:
   - **Compact**: Group consecutive completed iterations (e.g., "Iter 1-5 ✅")
   - **Scannable**: Use emojis (✅ ⏳ 🚧 🎨) and percentages prominently
   - **Highlight**: Mark CURRENT work explicitly in bold or with flag
   - **Indent**: Phase (no indent), Task (- prefix), Iteration (-- or nested -)
   - **Defer section**: Show V2/future items at bottom
   - **Skip noise**: Don't list every task name if they're obvious/sequential
   - **Focus on active work**: Emphasize in-progress and next items

5. **Example output** (payment gateway):

   ```
   📊 Flow Summary

   Version: V1
   Status: Phase 2, Task 5, Iteration 2 - In Progress

   Phase 1: Foundation ✅ 100%
   - Task 1-2: Setup, API, Database schema ✅

   Phase 2: Core Implementation 🚧 75%
   - Task 3-4: Payment processing, Webhooks ✅
   - Task 5: Error Handling
     - Iter 1 ✅: Retry logic
     - Iter 2 🚧 CURRENT: Circuit breaker
     - Iter 3 ⏳: Dead letter queue

   Phase 3: Testing & Integration ⏳ 0%
   - Task 6: Integration tests (pending)

   Deferred to V2:
   - Advanced features (monitoring, metrics)
   - Name generation

   ---
   TL;DR: Foundation done, core payment flow working, currently building circuit breaker for error handling.
   ```

   **Example output** (RED project - showing V1/V2 split):

   ```
   📊 Flow Summary - RED Ability Generation

   === V1 - Core System ===

   Phase 1: Foundation ✅ 100%
   - Task 1-4: Constants, enums, types, refactoring ✅

   Phase 2: Core Implementation 🚧 85%
   - Iter 1-5 ✅: Tier gen, slots, filtering, selection, template parsing
   - Iter 6 🚧 NEXT: Green.generate() integration (ties everything together)
   - Iter 7 ⏳: Blue validation (input guards)
   - Iter 9 ⏳ LAST: Red API wrapper (exposes Blue → Green)

   Phase 3: Testing
   - Script-based testing (Blue → Green flow)

   Deferred to V2:
   - Iter 8: Name generation (stub returns "Generated Ability")
   - Database persistence
   - Stats-based damage calculations

   === V2 - Enhanced System (Phase 4) ===

   Enhancements:
   - Potency system (stats × formulas replace fixed damage)
   - Name generation (124 weighted prefix/suffix combos)
   - 12 new placeholders (conditionals, resources, targeting)
   - Damage variance (±10% for crits)
   - Points & Luck systems
   - Database persistence

   ---
   TL;DR:
   V1 = Basic working system with hardcoded damage ranges (85% done, integration next)
   V2 = Dynamic formulas, character stats integration, full feature set
   ```

6. **Handle multiple versions**:
   - If PLAN.md has V2/V3 sections, use `=== V1 Summary ===` separator
   - V1 gets full Phase/Task/Iteration breakdown
   - V2+ get high-level "Enhancements" list (not full iteration tree)
   - Separate TL;DR line for each version

7. **After generating summary**:
   - "Use `/flow-status` to see detailed current position"
   - "Use `/flow-verify-plan` to verify accuracy against actual code"

**Manual alternative**:
- Read entire PLAN.md manually
- Create outline of all phases/tasks/iterations
- Count completions and calculate percentages
- Format into hierarchical view

**Output**: Hierarchical summary of entire project structure with completion tracking.

   - [List files changed but not mentioned in PLAN.md]

   Status: [SYNCHRONIZED / NEEDS UPDATE]
   ```

7. **If discrepancies found**:
   - Ask user: "PLAN.md is out of sync with project state. Update PLAN.md now? (yes/no)"
   - If yes: Update PLAN.md to reflect actual state:
     - Uncheck items that aren't actually done
     - Add notes about files modified
     - Update status markers if needed
   - If no: "Review discrepancies above and update PLAN.md manually."

8. **If synchronized**:
   - "PLAN.md is synchronized with project state. Ready to continue work."

**Manual alternative**:
- Review PLAN.md action items manually
- Check each completed item exists in codebase
- Use `git status` and `git diff` to verify changes
- Update PLAN.md to match reality

**Output**: Verification report and optional PLAN.md updates.

## /flow-compact

**File**: `flow-compact.md`

```markdown
You are executing the `/flow-compact` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive conversation report for context transfer to new AI instance.

**Context**:
- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: PLAN.md (current project)
- **Use case**: Before compacting conversation or starting new AI session - ensures zero context loss

**Instructions**:

1. **Find PLAN.md**: Look in current directory, traverse up if needed

2. **Run status verification first**:
   - Execute `/flow-status` command logic to verify current position
   - Check for conflicting status sections (warn if found)
   - Use this verified status as authoritative source for the report

3. **Generate comprehensive report covering**:

   **Current Work Context**:
   - What feature/task are we working on?
   - What phase/task/iteration are we in? (with status)
   - What was the original goal?

   **Conversation History**:
   - What decisions were made during brainstorming? (with rationale)
   - What subjects were discussed and resolved?
   - What pre-implementation tasks were identified and completed?
   - What action items were generated?

   **Implementation Progress**:
   - What has been implemented so far?
   - What files were created/modified?
   - What verification was done?
   - What remains incomplete?

   **Challenges & Solutions**:
   - What blockers were encountered?
   - How were they resolved?
   - What design trade-offs were made?

   **Next Steps**:
   - What is the immediate next action?
   - What are the pending action items?
   - What should the next AI instance focus on?

   **Important Context**:
   - Any quirks or special considerations for this feature
   - Technical constraints or dependencies
   - User preferences or decisions that must be preserved

4. **Report format**:
   ```
   # Context Transfer Report
   ## Generated: [Date/Time]

   ## Current Status
   [Phase/Task/Iteration with status markers]

   ## Feature Overview
   [What we're building and why]

   ## Conversation Summary
   [Chronological summary of discussions and decisions]

   ## Implementation Progress
   [What's done, what's in progress, what's pending]

   ## Key Decisions & Rationale
   [Critical decisions made with reasoning]

   ## Files Modified
   [List with brief description of changes]

   ## Challenges Encountered
   [Problems and how they were solved]

   ## Next Actions
   [Immediate next steps for new AI instance]

   ## Critical Context
   [Must-know information for continuation]
   ```

5. **Important guidelines**:
   - **Do NOT include generic project info** (tech stack, architecture overview, etc.)
   - **Focus ENTIRELY on the feature at hand** and this conversation
   - **Do NOT worry about token output length** - comprehensive is better than brief
   - **Include WHY, not just WHAT** - decisions need context
   - **Be specific** - reference exact file names, function names, line numbers
   - **Preserve user preferences** - if user made specific choices, document them

6. **After generating report**:
   - "Context transfer report generated. Copy this report to a new AI session to continue work with zero context loss."
   - "Use `/flow-verify-plan` before starting new session to ensure PLAN.md is synchronized."

**Manual alternative**:
- Read entire conversation history manually
- Summarize key points, decisions, and progress
- Document in separate notes file
- Reference PLAN.md for structure

**Output**: Comprehensive context transfer report.
```

## Installation Instructions

To use these commands:

1. **Copy individual command files** to `.claude/commands/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/commands
   # Copy each command section above into separate .md files
   # Example: flow-blueprint.md, flow-phase.md, etc.
   ```

2. **Or use the copy-paste method**:
   - Copy the content between the code blocks for each command
   - Create corresponding `.md` files in `.claude/commands/`
   - File names should match command names (e.g., `flow-blueprint.md`)

3. **Test with `/help`**: Run `/help` in Claude Code to see your new commands listed
