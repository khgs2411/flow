# Flow Framework - Slash Commands

This file contains all slash command definitions for the Flow framework. Copy these to `.claude/commands/` when ready to use.

---

## Command Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Every command must:

1. **Read the framework guide** at the start to understand patterns and structure
2. **Find and parse .flow/PLAN.md** to understand current state
3. **Follow framework patterns exactly** (status markers, section structure, etc.)
4. **Update .flow/PLAN.md** according to framework conventions
5. **Provide clear next steps** to the user

**File Locations**:
- **Plan File**: `.flow/PLAN.md` (Flow manages the plan from this directory)
- **Framework Guide**: Search in order:
  1. `.flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
  2. `.claude/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
  3. `./DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project root)
  4. `~/.claude/flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (global)

**Finding PLAN.md** (all commands except `/flow-blueprint` and `/flow-migrate`):
- Primary location: `.flow/PLAN.md`
- If not found, search project root and traverse up
- If still not found: Suggest `/flow-blueprint` (new project) or `/flow-migrate` (existing docs)

**Status Markers** (use consistently):
- ‚úÖ Complete
- ‚è≥ Pending
- üöß In Progress
- üé® Ready for Implementation
- ‚ùå Cancelled
- üîÆ Deferred

## /flow-blueprint

**File**: `flow-blueprint.md`

```markdown
---
description: Create new .flow/PLAN.md for a feature/project from scratch
---

You are executing the `/flow-blueprint` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Create a brand new PLAN.md file from scratch for a new feature/project/bug/issue.

**IMPORTANT**: This command ALWAYS creates a fresh `.flow/PLAN.md`, overwriting any existing plan file. Use `/flow-migrate` if you want to convert existing documentation.

**Instructions**:

1. **Read the framework guide**:
   - Search for DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md in these locations (in order):
     - `.flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `.claude/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `./DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project root)
     - `~/.claude/flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (global)
   - Read the first found location
   - Understand the hierarchy: PHASE ‚Üí TASK ‚Üí ITERATION ‚Üí BRAINSTORM ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION
   - Study the plan file template section
   - Note the status markers and section structure

2. **Analyze the feature request**: `$ARGUMENTS`

3. **Check for reference implementation**:
   - If user mentioned a reference path in arguments, use it
   - Otherwise, ask: "Do you have a reference implementation I should analyze? (Provide path or say 'no')"
   - If reference provided, read and analyze it to inform the planning

4. **Gather testing methodology** (CRITICAL - if not in $ARGUMENTS):
   - Ask: "How do you prefer to verify implementations? Choose or describe:
     - **Simulation-based (per-service)**: Each service has its own test file (e.g., `{service}.scripts.ts`)
     - **Simulation-based (single file)**: All tests in one orchestration file (e.g., `run.scripts.ts`)
     - **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/classes after implementation (Jest/Vitest/etc.)
     - **TDD**: Write tests before implementation, then make them pass
     - **Integration/E2E**: Focus on end-to-end workflows, minimal unit tests
     - **Manual QA**: No automated tests, manual verification only
     - **Custom**: Describe your approach"
   - **CRITICAL follow-up questions**:
     - "What's your test file naming convention?" (e.g., `{service}.scripts.ts`, `{feature}.test.ts`, `{feature}.spec.ts`)
     - "Where do test files live?" (e.g., `scripts/`, `__tests__/`, `tests/`, `e2e/`)
     - "When should I create NEW test files vs. add to existing?" (e.g., "Create `{service}.scripts.ts` for new services, add to existing for enhancements")
   - **IMPORTANT**: These answers determine how AI creates/modifies test files in every iteration

5. **Gather any other project-specific patterns** (if not clear from $ARGUMENTS):
   - File naming conventions (if mentioned or user specifies)
   - Directory structure preferences (if relevant)
   - Code style preferences (if mentioned)
   - Skip if not applicable to project type

6. **Generate .flow/PLAN.md** following the framework template (ALWAYS overwrites if exists):
   - Note: .flow/ directory already exists (created by flow.sh installation)
   - **Framework reference**: Link to DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md at top
   - **Overview section**: Purpose, goals, scope
   - **Architecture section**: High-level design, key components
   - **Testing Strategy section** (NEW - REQUIRED):
     - Document the testing methodology from step 4
     - **Must include**: Methodology, Location, Naming Convention, When to create, When to add, Tooling
     - Include file structure example showing test file organization
     - Add IMPORTANT section with ‚úÖ DO and ‚ùå DO NOT examples
     - Example for per-service simulation:
       ```markdown
       ## Testing Strategy
       **Methodology**: Simulation-based orchestration per service
       **Naming Convention**: `{service}.scripts.ts`
       **Location**: `scripts/` directory
       **When to create**: If `scripts/{service}.scripts.ts` doesn't exist for new service
       **When to add**: If file exists, add test cases to existing file
       **IMPORTANT**:
       - ‚úÖ Create `scripts/gold.scripts.ts` for new "gold" service
       - ‚úÖ Add to `scripts/blue.scripts.ts` for blue enhancements
       - ‚ùå Do NOT create `test.*.ts` files (wrong naming pattern)
       ```
     - Example for unit tests: "Unit tests created after implementation in __tests__/ using Jest. Create `{feature}.test.ts` for new features, add to existing for enhancements."
   - **Progress Dashboard**: For complex projects (optional, can add later)
   - **Development Plan**:
     - Estimate 2-4 phases (Foundation, Core Implementation, Testing, Enhancement/Polish)
     - For each phase: 1-5 tasks
     - For each task: 2-10 iterations (high-level names only)
     - Mark everything as ‚è≥ PENDING
     - Add placeholder brainstorming sessions (empty subject lists)

7. **Depth**: Medium detail
   - Phase names and strategies
   - Task names and purposes
   - Iteration names only (no brainstorming subjects yet)

8. **Confirm to user**:
   - "‚ú® Created .flow/PLAN.md with [X] phases, [Y] tasks, [Z] iterations"
   - "üìÇ Flow is now managing this project from .flow/ directory"
   - "Use `/flow-status` to see current state"
   - "Use `/flow-brainstorm_start [topic]` to begin first iteration"

**Output**: Create `.flow/PLAN.md` file and confirm creation to user.
```

## /flow-migrate

**File**: `flow-migrate.md`

```markdown
---
description: Migrate existing PRD/PLAN/TODO to Flow's .flow/PLAN.md format
---

You are executing the `/flow-migrate` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Migrate existing project documentation (PLAN.md, TODO.md, etc.) to Flow-compliant `.flow/PLAN.md` format.

**IMPORTANT**: This command ALWAYS creates a fresh `.flow/PLAN.md`, overwriting any existing plan file. It reads your current documentation and converts it to Flow format.

**Instructions**:

1. **Read the framework guide**:
   - Search for DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md in these locations (in order):
     - `.flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `.claude/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `./DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (project root)
     - `~/.claude/flow/DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (global)
   - Understand Flow's hierarchy: PHASE ‚Üí TASK ‚Üí ITERATION ‚Üí BRAINSTORM ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION
   - Study the Progress Dashboard template
   - Note all status markers (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ)

2. **Discover existing documentation**:
   - Check if user provided path in `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Otherwise, search project root for common files (in order):
     - `PRD.md` (common in TaskMaster AI, Spec-Kit)
     - `PLAN.md`
     - `TODO.md`
     - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
     - `ROADMAP.md`
     - `TASKS.md`
   - If multiple found, list them and ask: "Found [X] files. Which should I migrate? (number or path)"
   - If none found, ask: "No plan files found. Provide path to file you want to migrate, or use `/flow-blueprint` to start fresh."

3. **Read and analyze source file**:
   - Read entire source file
   - Detect structure type:
     - **STRUCTURED** (Path A): Has phases/tasks/iterations or similar hierarchy
     - **FLAT_LIST** (Path B): Simple todo list or numbered items
     - **UNSTRUCTURED** (Path C): Free-form notes, ideas, design docs
   - Extract key information:
     - Project context/purpose
     - Existing work completed
     - Current status/position
     - Remaining work
     - Architecture/design notes
     - V1/V2 splits (if mentioned)
     - Deferred items
     - Cancelled items

4. **Create backup**:
   - Copy source file: `[original].pre-flow-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)`
   - Confirm: "‚úÖ Backed up [original] to [backup]"

5. **Generate .flow/PLAN.md** based on detected structure (ALWAYS overwrites if exists):
   - Note: .flow/ directory already exists (created by flow.sh installation)

   **Path A - STRUCTURED** (already has phases/tasks):
   - Keep existing hierarchy
   - Add framework reference at top
   - Add/enhance Progress Dashboard section (after Overview, before Architecture)
   - **Remove duplicate progress sections** (search for patterns like "Current Phase:", "Implementation Tasks", old progress trackers)
   - **Update status pointers** (change "Search for 'Current Phase' below" to jump link to Progress Dashboard)
   - **Identify redundant framework docs** (ask user if sections like "Brainstorming Framework" should be removed since Flow provides this)
   - Standardize status markers (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ)
   - Add jump links to Progress Dashboard
   - Preserve all content, decisions, and context
   - Reformat sections to match Flow template
   - Report: "Enhanced existing structure (preserved [X] phases, [Y] tasks, [Z] iterations, removed [N] duplicate sections)"

   **Path B - FLAT_LIST** (todos/bullets):
   - Ask: "Group items into phases? (Y/n)"
   - If yes, intelligently group related items
   - If no, create single phase with items as iterations
   - Add framework reference
   - Add Progress Dashboard
   - Convert items to Flow iteration format
   - Add placeholder brainstorming sessions
   - Mark completed items as ‚úÖ, pending as ‚è≥
   - Report: "Converted flat list to Flow structure ([X] phases, [Y] tasks, [Z] iterations)"

   **Path C - UNSTRUCTURED** (notes):
   - Extract key concepts and features mentioned
   - Create Framework reference
   - Create Overview section from notes
   - Create Architecture section if design mentioned
   - Create Progress Dashboard (minimal - project just starting)
   - Create initial brainstorming session with subjects from notes
   - Mark everything as ‚è≥ PENDING
   - Report: "Created Flow plan from notes (extracted [X] key concepts as brainstorming subjects)"

7. **Add standard Flow sections** (all paths):
   - Framework reference: `> **üìñ Framework Guide**: See DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
   - Progress Dashboard (with proper format)
   - Development Plan with proper hierarchy
   - Status markers at every level

8. **Smart content preservation**:
   - NEVER discard user's original content
   - Preserve all decisions, rationale, context
   - Preserve code examples, file paths, references
   - Preserve completion status and dates
   - Enhance with Flow formatting, don't replace

9. **Confirm to user**:
   ```
   ‚ú® Migration complete!

   üìÇ Source: [original file path]
   üíæ Backup: [backup file path]
   üéØ Output: .flow/PLAN.md

   Migration type: [STRUCTURED/FLAT_LIST/UNSTRUCTURED]
   Changes:
     + Added Progress Dashboard with jump links
     + Enhanced [X] status markers
     + Preserved [Y] completed items
     + Preserved [Z] pending items
     + [other changes specific to migration type]

   Next steps:
     1. Review: diff [backup] .flow/PLAN.md
     2. Verify: /flow-status
     3. Start using Flow: /flow-brainstorm_start [topic]

   üìÇ Flow is now managing this project from .flow/ directory
   ```

10. **Handle edge cases**:
    - If source file is empty: Suggest `/flow-blueprint` instead
    - If source file is already Flow-compliant: Mention it's already compatible, migrate anyway
    - If can't determine structure: Default to Path C (unstructured)
    - If migration fails: Keep backup safe, report error, suggest manual approach

**Output**: Create `.flow/PLAN.md` from existing documentation, create backup, confirm migration to user.
```

   - **NEVER discard any user content** - only reformat and enhance
   - Update section order to match framework:
     1. Title + Framework Reference
     2. Overview (Purpose, Goals, Scope)
     3. **Progress Dashboard** (if complex project, OR create if missing)
     4. Architecture
     5. Development Plan (Phases ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Iterations)
   - Move Progress Dashboard if in wrong location (should be after Overview, before Architecture)
   - **Remove duplicate progress sections** (search for old "Implementation Tasks", "Current Phase" headers, redundant trackers)
   - **Update status pointers** (change old references like "Search for 'Current Phase' below" to jump link: `[Progress Dashboard](#-progress-dashboard)`)
   - **Clean up redundant framework documentation** (if user has custom brainstorming/workflow docs that duplicate Flow, ask if they want to remove)
   - Add Progress Dashboard if missing and project is complex (10+ iterations)

     + [other changes specific to this update]

   Next steps:
     1. Review changes: diff [backup] .flow/PLAN.md
     2. Verify: /flow-status
     3. Continue work: /flow-next

   All your content preserved - only structure enhanced.
   ```

8. **Handle edge cases**:
   - If `.flow/PLAN.md` doesn't exist: Suggest `/flow-blueprint` or `/flow-migrate`
   - If plan already matches latest structure: Report "Already up to date!"

You are executing the `/flow-brainstorm_resolve` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Mark a brainstorming subject as resolved with a decision.

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Parse arguments**: `$ARGUMENTS` = subject name/number

3. **Find subject**:
   - If number provided, find subject [N]
   - If name provided, find matching subject
   - Default: Find first ‚è≥ subject (not yet resolved)

4. **Update subject status**: Change ‚è≥ to ‚úÖ in "Subjects to Discuss" list

5. **Prompt user for details**:
   - "What decision did you make for this subject?"
   - "What's the rationale? (comma-separated reasons)"

6. **Determine resolution type** (IMPORTANT - choose ONE):

   **Type A: Pre-Implementation Task** (code changes needed before implementing iteration)
   - Ask: "Does this decision require code changes before implementing this iteration? (refactoring, bug fixes, system changes)"
   - If YES:
     - Create new pre-implementation task in "### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**" section
     - Include: Objective, Root Cause (if bug), Solution, Action Items, Files to Modify
     - Mark subject resolution as: "**Action Items**: Pre-Implementation Task [N] created"
     - Example: "Task 3: Fix Conversion Placeholder Requirement"

   **Type B: Immediate Documentation** (architectural decision, no code changes yet)
   - If NO code changes needed:
     - Document decision in appropriate section (Architecture, Design Decisions, etc.)
     - List conceptual action items (if any)
     - Example: "Added `foundational: boolean` property to architecture docs"

   **Type C: Auto-Resolved** (answered by another subject's decision)
   - If subject was resolved by cascade effect:
     - Mark as: "**Resolution**: Auto-resolved by Subject [X]'s decision"
     - Briefly explain why it's answered
     - No separate action items needed

7. **Add resolution section** under "Resolved Subjects":
   ```markdown
   ### ‚úÖ **Subject [N]: [Name]**

   **Decision**: [User's decision]

   **Rationale**:
   - [Reason 1]
   - [Reason 2]

   **Action Items**:
   - [ ] Pre-Implementation Task [N] created (Type A)
     OR
   - [ ] Updated Architecture section with [decision] (Type B)
     OR
   - Auto-resolved by Subject [X] (Type C)

   ---
   ```

8. **Update .flow/PLAN.md**: Update subject status, add resolution section, create pre-implementation task if Type A

9. **Suggest next action**:
   - Type A: "Created Pre-Implementation Task [N]. Continue with next subject or use `/flow-brainstorm_complete` when all subjects resolved."
   - Type B: "Documented decision. Continue with next subject or use `/flow-brainstorm_complete` when all subjects resolved."
   - Type C: "Auto-resolved. Continue with next subject or use `/flow-brainstorm_complete` when all subjects resolved."

10. **Confirm to user**: "Resolved Subject [N]: [Name] ([Resolution Type]). Use `/flow-brainstorm_subject` to add more, or `/flow-brainstorm_complete` when done."

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with resolved subject.

description: Complete brainstorming and generate action items
---

You are executing the `/flow-brainstorm_complete` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Close the current brainstorming session (only after pre-implementation tasks are done).

**IMPORTANT**: Pre-implementation tasks should be documented IN PLAN.md during brainstorming, then completed BEFORE running this command.

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Verify all subjects resolved**: Check "Subjects to Discuss" - all should be ‚úÖ

3. **Check for pre-implementation tasks**:
   - Look for "### **Pre-Implementation Tasks:**" section in PLAN.md
   - If found:
     - Check if all pre-tasks are marked ‚úÖ COMPLETE
     - If any are ‚è≥ PENDING or üöß IN PROGRESS:
       "Pre-implementation tasks exist but are not complete. Complete them first, then run this command again."
     - If all are ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Proceed to step 4
   - If not found:
     - Ask user: "Are there any pre-implementation tasks that need to be completed before starting the main implementation? (Refactoring, system-wide changes, bug fixes discovered during brainstorming, etc.)"
     - If yes: "Please document pre-implementation tasks in PLAN.md first (see framework guide), complete them, then run this command again."
     - If no: Proceed to step 4

4. **Update iteration status**: Change from üöß to üé® READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

5. **Add note**: "**Status**: All brainstorming complete, pre-implementation tasks done, ready for implementation"

6. **Confirm to user**: "Brainstorming session complete. Iteration is now üé® READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION. Use `/flow-implement_start` to begin."

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with brainstorming completion status.
```

## /flow-implement_start

**File**: `flow-implement_start.md`

```markdown
---
description: Begin implementation of current iteration
---

You are executing the `/flow-implement_start` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Begin implementation phase for the current iteration.

**Context**:
- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)
- **Framework Pattern**: See "Implementation Pattern" section in framework guide
- **Prerequisite**: Brainstorming must be ‚úÖ COMPLETE and all pre-implementation tasks done

**üö® SCOPE BOUNDARY RULE (CRITICAL)**:
If you discover NEW issues during implementation that are NOT part of the current iteration's action items:
1. **STOP** immediately
2. **NOTIFY** user of the new issue
3. **DISCUSS** what to do (add to brainstorm, create pre-task, defer, or handle now)
4. **ONLY** proceed with user's explicit approval
**Exception**: Syntax errors or blocking issues in files you must modify (document what you fixed)

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Find current iteration**: Look for iteration marked üé® READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

3. **Read Testing Strategy section** (CRITICAL):
   - Locate "## Testing Strategy" section in PLAN.md
   - Understand the verification methodology (simulation, unit tests, TDD, manual QA, etc.)
   - Note file locations, naming conventions, and when verification happens
   - **IMPORTANT**: Follow Testing Strategy exactly - do NOT create test files that violate conventions

4. **Verify readiness**:
   - Brainstorming should be marked ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - All pre-implementation tasks should be ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - If not ready: Warn user and ask to complete brainstorming first

5. **Update iteration status**: Change from üé® to üöß IN PROGRESS

6. **Create implementation section**:
   ```markdown
   ### **Implementation - Iteration [N]: [Name]**

   **Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS

   **Action Items** (from brainstorming):

   [Copy all unchecked action items from resolved subjects]

   **Implementation Notes**:

   [Leave blank for user to fill during implementation]

   **Files Modified**:

   [Leave blank - will be filled as work progresses]

   **Verification**: [Leave blank - how work will be verified]

   ---
   ```

6. **Confirm to user**: "Implementation started for Iteration [N]. Work through action items and check them off as you complete them. Use `/flow-implement_complete` when done."

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with implementation section and status change.
```

description: Mark current iteration as complete
---

You are executing the `/flow-implement_complete` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Mark the current iteration as complete.

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Find current iteration**: Look for iteration marked üöß IN PROGRESS

3. **Verify completion**:
   - Check all action items are ‚úÖ checked
   - If unchecked items remain: Ask user "There are unchecked action items. Are you sure you want to mark complete? (yes/no)"

4. **Prompt for verification notes**:
   - "How did you verify this iteration works? (tests, manual checks, etc.)"

5. **Update iteration status**: Change from üöß to ‚úÖ COMPLETE

6. **Update implementation section**:
   - Add verification notes
   - Add timestamp

7. **Add completion summary**:
   ```markdown
   **Implementation Results**:
   - [Summarize what was built]
   - [List key accomplishments]

   **Verification**: [User's verification method]

   **Completed**: [Date]
   ```

8. **Check if task/phase complete**:
   - If all iterations in task complete ‚Üí Mark task ‚úÖ
   - If all tasks in phase complete ‚Üí Mark phase ‚úÖ

9. **Confirm to user**: "Iteration [N] marked complete! Use `/flow-iteration [description]` to start next iteration, or `/flow-status` to see current state."

**Output**: Update .flow/PLAN.md with completion status and summary.
```

## /flow-status

**File**: `flow-status.md`

```markdown
---
description: Show current position and verify plan consistency
---

You are executing the `/flow-status` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Show current position in the plan.

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Parse Progress Dashboard** (if exists):
   - Look for "## üìã Progress Dashboard" section
   - Extract claimed current phase/task/iteration
   - Extract completion percentages
   - Note: Dashboard is manual, may need verification

3. **Parse status markers** (ground truth):
   - Find current phase (last phase with ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ)
   - Find current task (last task with ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ)
   - Find current iteration (last iteration with ‚è≥ üöß üé® ‚ùå üîÆ)
   - Count ‚úÖ COMPLETE items (these are frozen, skip verification)

4. **Smart verification** (active work only):
   - **Skip ‚úÖ COMPLETE items** - Already verified, now frozen
   - **Verify active work** (üöß ‚è≥ üé®):
     - Check if Progress Dashboard claims match markers
     - Check if ‚ùå CANCELLED items have reasons
     - Check if üîÆ DEFERRED items have reasons + destinations
   - **Report**:
     ```
     üîç Consistency Check (Active Work Only):

     ‚úÖ Phase 2 marker: üöß IN PROGRESS ‚úì
     ‚úÖ Task 5 marker: üöß IN PROGRESS ‚úì
     ‚úÖ Iteration 6 marker: üöß IN PROGRESS ‚úì

     ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped: 15 completed items (verified & frozen)

     Status: All active markers aligned with Progress Dashboard ‚úì
     ```

5. **If inconsistency detected**:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  INCONSISTENCY (Active Work):

   Progress Dashboard: Iteration 6 üöß IN PROGRESS
   Actual marker: Iteration 6 ‚è≥ PENDING

   Action: Update Progress Dashboard to match markers
   (Markers are ground truth)

   ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped: 15 completed items
   ```

6. **Display hierarchy**:
   ```
   üìã Current Status:

   Phase [N]: [Name] [Status]
     ‚îî‚îÄ Task [N]: [Name] [Status]
         ‚îî‚îÄ Iteration [N]: [Name] [Status]

   Next Action: [Suggest next command based on status]
   ```

7. **Suggest next action**:
   - If ‚è≥ PENDING ‚Üí "Use `/flow-brainstorm_start [topic]` to begin"
   - If üöß IN PROGRESS (brainstorming) ‚Üí "Continue resolving subjects with `/flow-brainstorm_resolve`"
   - If üé® READY ‚Üí "Use `/flow-implement_start` to begin implementation"
   - If üöß IN PROGRESS (implementing) ‚Üí "Work through action items, use `/flow-implement_complete` when done"
   - If ‚úÖ COMPLETE ‚Üí "Use `/flow-iteration [description]` to start next iteration"

8. **Show progress summary**:
   - Count completed vs total iterations
   - Count completed vs total tasks
   - Show percentage complete
   - Show deferred count (üîÆ)
   - Show cancelled count (‚ùå)

**Output**: Display current status, smart verification results, and suggest next action.

## /flow-summarize

**File**: `flow-summarize.md`

```markdown
---
description: Generate summary of all phases/tasks/iterations
---

You are executing the `/flow-summarize` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Generate high-level overview of entire project structure and completion state.

**Context**:
- **Framework Guide**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (auto-locate in `.claude/`, project root, or `~/.claude/flow/`)
- **Working File**: .flow/PLAN.md (current project)
- **Use case**: "Bird's eye view" of project health, progress across all phases, quick status reports

**Comparison to other commands**:
- `/flow-status` = "Where am I RIGHT NOW?" (micro view - current iteration)
- `/flow-summarize` = "What's the WHOLE PICTURE?" (macro view - all phases/tasks/iterations)
- `/flow-verify-plan` = "Is this accurate?" (validation)
- `/flow-compact` = "Transfer full context" (comprehensive handoff)

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Parse entire PLAN.md structure**:
   - Extract Version (from metadata at top)
   - Extract current Status line (from metadata)
   - Parse ALL phases with their status markers
   - For each phase, parse ALL tasks
   - For each task, parse ALL iterations
   - Track completion percentages at each level

3. **Generate structured summary** (compact, scannable format):

   ```
   üìä Flow Summary

   Version: [V1/V2/V3]
   Status: [Current phase/task/iteration from metadata]

   Phase [N]: [Name] [Status] [%]
   - Task [N]: [Name] [Status]
     - Iter [N-N] [Status]: [Concise description]
     - Iter [N] üöß CURRENT: [What you're working on]
     - Iter [N] ‚è≥: [What's next]

   Phase [N]: [Name] [Status] [%]
   - Task [N-N]: [Grouped if similar] [Status]
   - Task [N]: [Name] [Status]

   Deferred to V2:
   - [Iteration/feature name]
   - [Iteration/feature name]

   ---
   TL;DR: [One punchy sentence about overall state]
   ```

4. **Formatting rules**:
   - **Compact**: Group consecutive completed iterations (e.g., "Iter 1-5 ‚úÖ")
   - **Scannable**: Use emojis (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üöß üé®) and percentages prominently
   - **Highlight**: Mark CURRENT work explicitly in bold or with flag
   - **Indent**: Phase (no indent), Task (- prefix), Iteration (-- or nested -)
   - **Defer section**: Show V2/future items at bottom
   - **Skip noise**: Don't list every task name if they're obvious/sequential
   - **Focus on active work**: Emphasize in-progress and next items

5. **Example output** (payment gateway):

   ```
   üìä Flow Summary

   Version: V1
   Status: Phase 2, Task 5, Iteration 2 - In Progress

   Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ 100%
   - Task 1-2: Setup, API, Database schema ‚úÖ

   Phase 2: Core Implementation üöß 75%
   - Task 3-4: Payment processing, Webhooks ‚úÖ
   - Task 5: Error Handling
     - Iter 1 ‚úÖ: Retry logic
     - Iter 2 üöß CURRENT: Circuit breaker
     - Iter 3 ‚è≥: Dead letter queue

   Phase 3: Testing & Integration ‚è≥ 0%
   - Task 6: Integration tests (pending)

   Deferred to V2:
   - Advanced features (monitoring, metrics)
   - Name generation

   ---
   TL;DR: Foundation done, core payment flow working, currently building circuit breaker for error handling.
   ```

   **Example output** (RED project - showing V1/V2 split):

   ```
   üìä Flow Summary - RED Ability Generation

   === V1 - Core System ===

   Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ 100%
   - Task 1-4: Constants, enums, types, refactoring ‚úÖ

   Phase 2: Core Implementation üöß 85%
   - Iter 1-5 ‚úÖ: Tier gen, slots, filtering, selection, template parsing
   - Iter 6 üöß NEXT: Green.generate() integration (ties everything together)
   - Iter 7 ‚è≥: Blue validation (input guards)
   - Iter 9 ‚è≥ LAST: Red API wrapper (exposes Blue ‚Üí Green)

   Phase 3: Testing
   - Script-based testing (Blue ‚Üí Green flow)

   Deferred to V2:
   - Iter 8: Name generation (stub returns "Generated Ability")
   - Database persistence
   - Stats-based damage calculations

   === V2 - Enhanced System (Phase 4) ===

   Enhancements:
   - Potency system (stats √ó formulas replace fixed damage)
   - Name generation (124 weighted prefix/suffix combos)
   - 12 new placeholders (conditionals, resources, targeting)
   - Damage variance (¬±10% for crits)
   - Points & Luck systems
   - Database persistence

   ---
   TL;DR:
   V1 = Basic working system with hardcoded damage ranges (85% done, integration next)
   V2 = Dynamic formulas, character stats integration, full feature set
   ```

6. **Add deferred/cancelled sections**:
   ```
   üîÆ Deferred Items:
   - Iteration 10: Name Generation (V2 - complexity, needs 124 components)
   - Task 12: Advanced Features (V2 - out of V1 scope)
   - Feature X: Multi-provider support (V3 - abstraction layer)

   ‚ùå Cancelled Items:
   - Task 8: Custom HTTP Client (rejected - SDK is better)
   - Subject 3: GraphQL API (rejected - REST is sufficient)
   ```

7. **Smart verification** (active work only):
   - Skip ‚úÖ COMPLETE items (verified & frozen)
   - Verify üöß ‚è≥ üé® items match Progress Dashboard
   - Check ‚ùå items have reasons
   - Check üîÆ items have reasons + destinations
   - Report:
     ```
     üîç Verification (Active Work Only):
     ‚úÖ All active markers (üöß ‚è≥) match Progress Dashboard
     ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped 18 completed items (verified & frozen)
     ```

8. **Handle multiple versions**:
   - If PLAN.md has V2/V3 sections, use `=== V1 Summary ===` separator
   - V1 gets full Phase/Task/Iteration breakdown
   - V2+ get high-level "Enhancements" list (not full iteration tree)
   - Separate TL;DR line for each version

9. **After generating summary**:
   - "Use `/flow-status` to see detailed current position"
   - "Use `/flow-verify-plan` to verify accuracy against actual code"

**Manual alternative**:
- Read entire PLAN.md manually
- Create outline of all phases/tasks/iterations
- Count completions and calculate percentages
- Format into hierarchical view

**Output**: Hierarchical summary of entire project structure with completion tracking.

3. **Generate comprehensive report covering**:

   **Current Work Context**:
   - What feature/task are we working on?
   - What phase/task/iteration are we in? (with status)
   - What was the original goal?

   **Conversation History**:
   - What decisions were made during brainstorming? (with rationale)
   - What subjects were discussed and resolved?
   - What pre-implementation tasks were identified and completed?
   - What action items were generated?

   **Implementation Progress**:
   - What has been implemented so far?
   - What files were created/modified?
   - What verification was done?
   - What remains incomplete?

   **Challenges & Solutions**:
   - What blockers were encountered?
   - How were they resolved?
   - What design trade-offs were made?

   **Next Steps**:
   - What is the immediate next action?
   - What are the pending action items?
   - What should the next AI instance focus on?

   **Important Context**:
   - Any quirks or special considerations for this feature
   - Technical constraints or dependencies
   - User preferences or decisions that must be preserved

4. **Report format**:
   ```
   # Context Transfer Report
   ## Generated: [Date/Time]

   ## Current Status
   [Phase/Task/Iteration with status markers]

   ## Feature Overview
   [What we're building and why]

   ## Conversation Summary
   [Chronological summary of discussions and decisions]

   ## Implementation Progress
   [What's done, what's in progress, what's pending]

   ## Key Decisions & Rationale
   [Critical decisions made with reasoning]

   ## Files Modified
   [List with brief description of changes]

   ## Challenges Encountered
   [Problems and how they were solved]

   ## Next Actions
   [Immediate next steps for new AI instance]

   ## Critical Context
   [Must-know information for continuation]
   ```

5. **Important guidelines**:
   - **Do NOT include generic project info** (tech stack, architecture overview, etc.)
   - **Focus ENTIRELY on the feature at hand** and this conversation
   - **Do NOT worry about token output length** - comprehensive is better than brief
   - **Include WHY, not just WHAT** - decisions need context
   - **Be specific** - reference exact file names, function names, line numbers
   - **Preserve user preferences** - if user made specific choices, document them

6. **After generating report**:
   - "Context transfer report generated. Copy this report to a new AI session to continue work with zero context loss."
   - "Use `/flow-verify-plan` before starting new session to ensure PLAN.md is synchronized."

**Manual alternative**:
- Read entire conversation history manually

## Installation Instructions

To use these commands:

1. **Copy individual command files** to `.claude/commands/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/commands
   # Copy each command section above into separate .md files
   # Example: flow-blueprint.md, flow-phase.md, etc.
   ```

2. **Or use the copy-paste method**:
   - Copy the content between the code blocks for each command
   - Create corresponding `.md` files in `.claude/commands/`
   - File names should match command names (e.g., `flow-blueprint.md`)

3. **Test with `/help`**: Run `/help` in Claude Code to see your new commands listed
