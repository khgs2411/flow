description: Guide implementation workflow in Flow framework. Use when user says "implement", "implement this", "let's code", "let's implement", "start building", "time to write code", "time to code", "execute action items", "ready to implement", or is ready to implement. Enforces pre-implementation gate (brainstorming must be complete), guides use of /flow-implement-start and /flow-implement-complete commands, tracks action item completion, ensures verification before marking work complete.

# Flow Implementer

Help users execute implementation work in Flow framework projects. This Skill ensures AI follows Flow's implementation pattern: verify readiness ‚Üí start implementation ‚Üí execute action items ‚Üí verify completion ‚Üí mark complete.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user wants to start coding:
- "Let's implement this"
- "Start coding"
- "Build the feature"
- "Time to write code"
- "Ready to implement"
- "Execute the action items"
- "Begin implementation"

## Implementation Philosophy

**Flow's Core Principle**: Design before code. Implementation happens AFTER brainstorming is complete (if needed) and pre-implementation tasks are done.

**Key Gates**:
- **Pre-Implementation Gate**: Brainstorming must be ‚úÖ COMPLETE (if iteration had brainstorming)
- **Pre-Tasks Gate**: All pre-implementation tasks must be ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Verification Gate**: All action items done, tests passing, ready for next work

**Implementation Pattern**: Start ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Complete

## Pre-Implementation Gate Check

Before starting ANY implementation, verify readiness:

### Check 1: Brainstorming Status (if applicable)

```
IF iteration has brainstorming section:
    IF brainstorming status ‚â† ‚úÖ COMPLETE:
        ‚ùå BLOCK implementation
        SUGGEST: "Brainstorming must be completed first. Use `/flow-next-subject` to continue brainstorming."
    ELSE:
        ‚úÖ PASS gate
ELSE:
    ‚úÖ PASS gate (no brainstorming needed)
```

### Check 2: Pre-Implementation Tasks (if applicable)

```
IF iteration has "Pre-Implementation Tasks" section:
    IF any pre-task status ‚â† ‚úÖ COMPLETE:
        ‚ùå BLOCK implementation
        LIST incomplete pre-tasks
        SUGGEST: "Complete pre-tasks first, then use `/flow-implement-start`"
    ELSE:
        ‚úÖ PASS gate
ELSE:
    ‚úÖ PASS gate (no pre-tasks)
```

### Check 3: Iteration Status

```
IF iteration status = üöß IN PROGRESS:
    ‚úÖ PASS (already implementing)
IF iteration status = üé® READY or ‚è≥ PENDING:
    SUGGEST: "Use `/flow-implement-start` to begin implementation"
```

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Start Implementation

**Command**: `/flow-implement-start`

**What it does**:
- Marks iteration üöß IN PROGRESS
- Creates "Implementation" section in task file
- Updates DASHBOARD.md current work

**When to suggest**: User is ready to code and gates passed

### Step 2: Execute Action Items

**Sequential Execution**:
1. Read action items from iteration (or brainstorming Type D subjects)
2. Execute each action item in order
3. Check off items as completed: `- [x] Action item`
4. Document progress in "Implementation Notes"

**Parallel Execution** (when safe):
- If action items are independent (no dependencies)
- Example: Creating multiple unrelated files
- Still check off sequentially for tracking

**Handling Blockers**:
```
IF encounter blocker during implementation:
    DOCUMENT blocker in Implementation Notes
    ASSESS severity:
        - Minor (< 15 min fix): Handle and continue
        - Major (> 15 min, out of scope): STOP and notify user
        - Blocking (cannot proceed): Mark iteration ‚ùå BLOCKED, notify user
```

### Step 3: Verify Completion

Before marking iteration complete, verify:

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] All action items checked off (‚úÖ)
- [ ] Code compiles/runs without errors
- [ ] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Files modified documented
- [ ] Implementation notes updated
- [ ] No unresolved blockers

**Testing Strategy** (from PLAN.md):
- Follow Testing Strategy section in PLAN.md
- Run tests according to project conventions
- Document test results in Implementation Notes

### Step 4: Complete Implementation

**Command**: `/flow-implement-complete`

**What it does**:
- Marks iteration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Updates completion date
- Updates DASHBOARD.md progress
- Advances to next iteration

**When to suggest**: All verification criteria met

## Implementation Slash Commands

### `/flow-implement-start`

**Use when**: Starting implementation for current iteration

**Prerequisites**:
- Brainstorming ‚úÖ COMPLETE (if applicable)
- Pre-tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETE (if applicable)
- Iteration status = üé® READY or ‚è≥ PENDING

**Effect**:
- Changes iteration status to üöß IN PROGRESS
- Creates implementation section in task file
- Updates DASHBOARD.md

### `/flow-implement-complete`

**Use when**: All action items done and verified

**Prerequisites**:
- All action items checked off
- Verification criteria met
- No unresolved blockers

**Effect**:
- Marks iteration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Updates completion date
- Advances to next iteration or task

## Action Item Execution Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Implementation

**Use when**: Action items depend on each other

```markdown
Action Items:
- [x] Create database schema
- [x] Implement data access layer (depends on schema)
- [x] Add service layer (depends on DAL)
- [x] Create API endpoints (depends on service)
```

**Approach**:
1. Complete item 1
2. Verify item 1 works
3. Move to item 2
4. Repeat until all done

### Pattern 2: Parallel Implementation

**Use when**: Action items are independent

```markdown
Action Items:
- [ ] Create logger utility
- [ ] Create validator utility
- [ ] Create formatter utility
```

**Approach**:
1. Create all three files
2. Verify each works independently
3. Check off all items

### Pattern 3: Incremental Verification

**Use when**: Complex implementation with multiple steps

```markdown
Action Items:
- [x] Implement basic authentication (VERIFY: can login)
- [x] Add JWT token generation (VERIFY: tokens valid)
- [x] Add token refresh (VERIFY: refresh works)
- [x] Add logout (VERIFY: tokens invalidated)
```

**Approach**:
1. Complete one action item
2. Test/verify immediately
3. Document verification in notes
4. Move to next item

## Pre-Implementation Tasks Pattern

### What Are Pre-Implementation Tasks?

Small blocking tasks (< 30 min) that must be completed BEFORE main iteration work starts.

**Examples**:
- Refactor interface to support new pattern
- Update enum with missing values
- Fix bug in legacy code
- Rename file to match convention

### When to Complete Pre-Tasks

```
IF iteration has "Pre-Implementation Tasks" section:
    FOR EACH pre-task:
        Complete pre-task
        Mark ‚úÖ COMPLETE with date
        Document changes in pre-task section
    ONLY AFTER ALL PRE-TASKS DONE:
        Run /flow-implement-start for main iteration
```

### Pre-Task Structure

```markdown
#### Pre-Implementation Tasks

##### ‚è≥ Pre-Task 1: Update ErrorHandler to support async

**Why Blocking**: Retry logic requires async error handling

**Scope** (< 30 min):
- Update ErrorHandler.ts with async support
- Add retryAsync() method
- Update 3 call sites

**Files**:
- src/utils/ErrorHandler.ts

---

##### ‚úÖ Pre-Task 1: Update ErrorHandler to support async

**Completed**: 2025-10-30

**Changes Made**:
- Added async support to ErrorHandler class
- Implemented retryAsync() method with exponential backoff
- Updated call sites in BillingService, PaymentService, OrderService
- Added unit tests for async error handling

**Files Modified**:
- src/utils/ErrorHandler.ts (+42 lines)
- tests/utils/ErrorHandler.test.ts (+28 lines)
```

## Verification Best Practices

### What to Verify

**Code Quality**:
- [ ] No syntax errors
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Follows project conventions
- [ ] Code is readable and well-structured

**Functionality**:
- [ ] Feature works as intended
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] No regressions introduced

**Testing**:
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Manual testing done (if no automated tests)

**Documentation**:
- [ ] Implementation notes updated
- [ ] Files modified list complete
- [ ] Verification results documented

### When to Mark ‚ùå BLOCKED

Mark iteration ‚ùå BLOCKED when:
- External dependency not available
- Blocker requires > 1 hour to resolve
- Need user decision before proceeding
- Technical limitation discovered

**Blocked Pattern**:
```markdown
### ‚ùå Iteration 2: Error Handling

**Status**: ‚ùå BLOCKED

**Blocker**: Stripe SDK doesn't support custom retry logic in v12

**Options**:
A) Downgrade to Stripe SDK v11 (supports custom retry)
B) Wait for v13 release (eta 2 weeks)
C) Implement wrapper around SDK calls

**Waiting for**: User decision on approach
```

## Scope Boundary Rules

### When You Discover New Work

During implementation, if you discover issues NOT in current action items:

1. **STOP** - Don't make assumptions
2. **ASSESS** - Categorize the issue:
   - Syntax error in file you're editing? Fix and document
   - Missing functionality? Discuss with user
   - New feature idea? Defer to future iteration
   - Blocking bug? Propose pre-implementation task

3. **NOTIFY** user with structured options:
   - **Option A**: Create pre-implementation task (< 30 min, blocking)
   - **Option B**: Add as new brainstorming subject (design needed)
   - **Option C**: Handle immediately (if user approves)
   - **Option D**: Defer to separate iteration (after current work)

4. **AWAIT** user decision before proceeding

### Example: Scope Boundary Alert

```
‚ö†Ô∏è SCOPE BOUNDARY ALERT

During implementation of Iteration 2 (Error Handling), discovered:

**Issue**: PaymentService.ts uses deprecated error format that conflicts with new retry logic

**Impact**: Cannot complete current action item without addressing this

**Options**:
A) Create pre-implementation task (estimated 20 min):
   - Update PaymentService error format
   - Update 2 call sites
   - Add to Pre-Implementation Tasks section

B) Add as brainstorming subject:
   - Need to design error format standard across all services
   - Affects more than just PaymentService

C) Handle immediately:
   - Fix PaymentService.ts now as part of current work
   - Document change in Implementation Notes

D) Defer to separate iteration:
   - Work around issue for now
   - Create new iteration for error format standardization

Which approach would you prefer?
```

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Pattern: Feature Implementation

```
User: "Let's implement the authentication system"

AI Response:
I'll help you implement the authentication system. Let me check readiness:

‚úÖ Brainstorming Session - COMPLETE (4 subjects resolved)
‚úÖ Pre-Implementation Tasks - COMPLETE (updated User model)
‚úÖ Iteration Status - üé® READY

Ready to implement! Use `/flow-implement-start` to begin.

Action items from brainstorming:
1. Create AuthService class
2. Implement login/logout methods
3. Add JWT token generation
4. Integrate with API endpoints
5. Add authentication middleware

Estimated time: 3-4 hours

Should I start implementation?
```

### Pattern: Handling Blockers

```
User: "Start implementing the payment integration"

AI Response:
I'll help you implement payment integration. Let me check readiness:

‚ùå Pre-Implementation Tasks - INCOMPLETE

Found 2 incomplete pre-tasks:
1. ‚è≥ Pre-Task 1: Refactor PaymentConfig interface
2. ‚è≥ Pre-Task 2: Update environment variables

These tasks must be completed before main implementation. Should I help you complete them now?
```

### Pattern: Verification Before Completion

```
User: "Are we done with this iteration?"

AI Response:
Let me verify completion criteria:

‚úÖ All action items checked off (5/5)
‚úÖ Code compiles without errors
‚úÖ Tests passing (unit: 12/12, integration: 3/3)
‚úÖ Files modified documented (4 files)
‚úÖ Implementation notes updated
‚úÖ No unresolved blockers

Verification complete! All criteria met.

Use `/flow-implement-complete` to mark this iteration done and move to the next one.
```

### Pattern: Incremental Progress

```
User: "How's the implementation going?"

AI Response:
Implementation progress for Iteration 2: Error Handling

Completed (3/5):
- [x] Create RetryPolicy class
- [x] Implement exponential backoff algorithm
- [x] Add configuration for max retries

In Progress (1/5):
- [ ] Integrate with StripeClient ‚Üê CURRENT (60% done)

Pending (1/5):
- [ ] Add tests for retry scenarios

Estimated completion: 1 hour

Working on integrating RetryPolicy with StripeClient.ts. Will move to tests next.
```
