## Overview

### Purpose

Build a production-ready payment gateway integration that allows our platform to accept credit card payments through Stripe. The system must handle synchronous payment processing, asynchronous webhook notifications for payment events, and provide robust error handling with retry logic for transient failures.

This integration is critical for monetization and must meet PCI compliance requirements while maintaining <2s response time for payment operations.

### Goals

**Primary Goals**:
- Process credit card payments via Stripe API with <2s response time
- Handle webhook events for async payment state notifications (payment succeeded, failed, refunded)
- Implement automatic retry logic for transient API failures (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
- Maintain 99.9% payment processing success rate (excluding card declines)
- Ensure PCI compliance through proper token handling (no raw card data stored)

**Success Criteria**:
- Payment processing works end-to-end in production
- All webhook events handled correctly with idempotency
- Error rate < 0.1% (excluding legitimate declines)
- Test coverage > 85% for payment critical paths
- Security audit passed for PCI compliance

### Scope

**V1 Scope** (Current Session):
- Credit card payment processing (charges API)
- Basic subscription support (create, cancel)
- Webhook handler for critical events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.failed`, `charge.refunded`
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Error handling: Map Stripe errors to domain errors
- Basic authentication with API keys
- USD currency only
- Payment history storage in PostgreSQL

## Architecture

### System Context

The payment gateway integration follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns: API Layer (request handling), Service Layer (business logic), Integration Layer (Stripe API wrapper), and Data Layer (persistence).

**Components**:
- **PaymentService**: Orchestrates payment processing flow (createPayment, processPayment, refundPayment)
- **StripeClient**: Stripe API wrapper with retry logic and error mapping (singleton pattern)
- **WebhookHandler**: Processes incoming Stripe webhook events with signature verification and idempotency
- **PaymentRepository**: Payment data persistence with ACID transaction support
- **ErrorMapper**: Translates Stripe errors to domain errors for decoupling

**Key Dependencies**:
- **Stripe Node SDK** (v12.18.0): Official API client with TypeScript support
- **Existing Auth Service**: User authentication for protected endpoints
- **PostgreSQL** (v14+): Database with transaction support for payment state

**Reference Implementations**:
- **Existing PayPal Integration** (`src/legacy/billing.ts`): Webhook signature validation pattern
- **Shipment Webhook Handler** (`src/webhooks/shipment.ts`): Idempotency pattern using event IDs

## DO / DON'T Guidelines

**‚úÖ DO**:
- Always validate webhook signatures before processing events (security critical)
- Use transactions for all payment state changes (data integrity)
- Map Stripe errors to domain errors immediately (decouple from provider)
- Implement idempotency for webhook event processing (handle duplicate events)
- Log all payment operations for audit trail (PCI compliance)
- Use exponential backoff for retries (avoid thundering herd)

**‚ùå DO NOT**:
- Store raw card numbers in database (PCI violation - use tokens only)
- Skip webhook signature verification (security risk)
- Hard-code Stripe error codes in business logic (tight coupling)
- Process duplicate webhook events (use event ID deduplication)
- Return detailed error messages to client for declined cards (security)
- Retry non-transient errors (e.g., card declined, invalid request)

## Notes & Learnings

**Design Decisions**:
- **2025-01-13**: Using exponential backoff with 3 retries max for API calls - balances reliability with user experience
- **2025-01-14**: Mapping Stripe errors to domain errors - decouples domain logic from Stripe SDK, enables future provider switching
- **2025-01-13**: Deferring circuit breaker pattern to V2 - basic retry is sufficient for V1, reduces complexity
